Welcome to the Diff Annotator tutorial! In this tutorial, we will show you how to use the Diff Annotator to annotate HTML renderings of git diff files.
To use the Diff Annotator, upload two text files for comparison by clicking on the "Upload" button and selecting the files from your computer. After uploading the files, give the text-comparison a name and click on the "Compare" button to start the comparison process.
After processing, the HTML rendering of the git diff will be displayed in your web browser like this text. You can now read, correct, and annotate the diff. To make an annotation, simply select some text and click on the "Annotate" button. You can also correct or merge variants by clicking on them and selecting the appropriate action from the menu.
In addition to making annotations to specific variants, you can also add general notes to the document by clicking on the "Add Note" button. Advanced users can even edit the source code by calling up the HTML of a selection of paragraphs (with a maximum of 5 consecutive paragraphs).
That's it! You now know how to use the Diff Annotator to annotate HTML renderings of git diff files. We hope you find this tool useful and enjoy using it!
