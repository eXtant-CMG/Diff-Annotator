Chapter 1
On a very hot day in August of 1994, <span class="app" id="app-7040r27"><span class="f1">the pharmacist at</span><span class="f2">my wife told me she was going down to</span></span> the Derry Rite Aid <span class="app" id="app-6976v99"><span class="f1">called my wife, Johanna, and told her that</span><span class="f2">to pick up a refill on</span></span> her sinus medicine <span class="app" id="app-7168k36"><span class="f1">was ready. It's</span><span class="f2">prescription—this is</span></span> stuff you can buy over the counter these days, I believe. <span class="app" id="app-7104w54"><span class="f1">Maybe the fundamental things do apply as time goes by, but the little things change a lot, I have noticed.</span></span> 
<span class="app" id="app-71x0x4xw54"><span class="f1">I had</span><span class="f2">I'd</span></span> finished my writing for the day and offered to pick it up for her. She said thanks, but she wanted to get a piece of fish at the supermarket <span class="app" id="app-7040l59"><span class="f1">for supper anyway,</span><span class="f2">next door anyway; two birds with one stone</span></span> and <span class="app" id="app-6976w10"><span class="f1">she could do it on her way home.</span><span class="f2">all of that.</span></span> She blew a kiss at me off the palm of her hand and went out. The next time I saw her, she was on TV. That's how you identify the dead here in Derry—no walking down a subterranean corridor with green tiles <span class="app" id="app-7040u22"><span class="f1">underfoot</span><span class="f2">on the walls</span></span> and long fluorescent bars overhead, no naked body rolling out of a chilly <span class="app" id="app-6976n99"><span class="f1">locker</span><span class="f2">drawer</span></span> on casters; you just go into an office marked PRIVATE and look at a TV screen and say yep or nope.<span class="app" id="z-2640"><span class="f1">Same principal, I suppose--the fundamental things apply.</span></span> The Rite Aid <span class="app" id="app-7040j77"><span class="f1">is</span><span class="f2">and the Shopwell are</span></span> less than a mile <span class="app" id="app-7104e13"><span class="f1">eke</span><span class="f2">from</span></span> our house, in a little neighborhood <span class="app" id="app-7168h33"><span class="f1">shopping center</span><span class="f2">strip mall</span></span> which also supports a video store, a <span class="app" id="app-7232h82"><span class="f1">used bookstore</span><span class="f2">used-book store</span></span> named Spread It Around (they do a very brisk business in my old <span class="app" id="app-6976f89"><span class="f1">paperbacks, I'm told),</span><span class="f2">paperbacks),</span></span> a Radio Shack, and a Fast Foto. It's on Up-Mile Hill, at the intersection of Witcham and <span class="app" id="app-7040r33"><span class="f1">Jackson, a busy location that has seen its share of car accidents over the years. Johanna was always a safe driver, though; unless she hid a speeding ticket or two from me (I hid one or two from her, if you must know), she never had so much as a single run-in with the law in her thirty-six years of life, let alone an accident.</span><span class="f2">Jackson.</span></span>
She parked in front of Blockbuster Video, went into the drugstore, and did business with Mr. Joe Wyzer, who was the druggist in those days; he has since moved <span class="app" id="app-7104f41"><span class="f1">on. To</span><span class="f2">on to</span></span> the Rite Aid in <span class="app" id="app-7168x71"><span class="f1">Bangor, I believe someone told me. The prescription was twelve dollars and eighteen cents. She bought something else which is just identified as "sundry" on</span><span class="f2">Bangor. At</span></span> the <span class="app" id="app-7232v82"><span class="f1">cash register slip, an item which cost forty-nine cents. When I was finally able to inventory her purse— when I could bring myself to do it is what I mean,</span><span class="f2">checkout she picked up one</span></span> of <span class="app" id="app-6976k82"><span class="f1">poursems oo found a foil-wrapped chocolate mouse</span><span class="f2">those little chocolates with marshmallow inside, this one</span></span> in<span class="app" id="z-2400"><span class="f1">amongst the Kleenex, half-finished rolls of Certs, and</span></span> the <span class="app" id="app-7232n13"><span class="f1">jumble</span><span class="f2">shape</span></span> of<span class="app" id="z-912"><span class="f1">makeup. If such an item isn't</span></span> a <span class="app" id="app-6976y36"><span class="f1">sundry, then</span><span class="f2">mouse.</span></span> I <span class="app" id="app-7296q76"><span class="f1">don't know what is. It was the last thing my wife ever bought</span><span class="f2">found it later,</span></span> in <span class="app" id="app-7168c83"><span class="f1">this world: a chocolate mouse with marshmallow inside it. 1</span><span class="f2">her purse. I</span></span> unwrapped it and ate it myself, sitting at the kitchen table with the contents of her <span class="app" id="app-7360w23"><span class="f1">purse</span><span class="f2">red handbag</span></span> spread out in front of me, and it was like taking <span class="app" id="app-7232n94"><span class="f1">communion.</span><span class="f2">Communion.</span></span> When it was gone except for the taste of chocolate on my tongue and in my <span class="app" id="app-6976r55"><span class="f1">throat</span><span class="f2">throat,</span></span> I burst into tears. I sat there <span class="app" id="z-2304"><span class="f2">in the litter of her Kleenex and makeup and keys and half-finished rolls of Certs</span></span> and cried <span class="app" id="z-2592"><span class="f2">with my hands over my eyes, the way a kid cries. The sinus inhaler was in a Rite Aid bag. It had cost twelve dollars and eighteen cents. There was something else in the bag, too—an item which had cost twenty-two-fifty. I looked at this other item</span></span> for <span class="app" id="app-7296t30"><span class="f1">almost half an hour.</span><span class="f2">a long time, seeing it but not understanding it. I was surprised, maybe even stunned, but the idea that</span></span> Johanna <span class="app" id="z-3648"><span class="f2">Arlen Noonan might have been leading another life, one I knew nothing about, never crossed my mind. Not then.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-2352"><span class="f2">*   *   *</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-2880"><span class="f2">Jo</span></span> left the register, walked out into the bright, hammering sun again, swapping her regular glasses for her prescription sunglasses as she did, and just as she stepped from beneath the <span class="app" id="app-7168u21"><span class="f1">drug store's</span><span class="f2">drugstore's</span></span> slight overhang (I am imagining a little here, I suppose, crossing over into the country of the novelist a little, but not by much; only by inches, and you can trust me on that), there was that shrewish howl of locked tires on pavement that means there's<span class="app" id="z-2976"><span class="f1">either</span></span> going to be <span class="app" id="z-2448"><span class="f2">either</span></span> an accident or a very close call.
This time <span class="app" id="app-7232c39"><span class="f1">the accident happened-—the</span><span class="f2">it happened—the</span></span> sort of accident which happened at that stupid <span class="app" id="app-6976b83"><span class="f1">Nnened</span><span class="f2">X-shaped</span></span> intersection at least once a week, it seemed. A 1989 Toyota was pulling out of the <span class="app" id="app-7296e44"><span class="f1">shopping center</span><span class="f2">shopping-center</span></span> parking lot and turning left onto Jackson Street. Behind the wheel was Mrs. Esther <span class="app" id="app-7360a84"><span class="f1">Easterling, a widow from</span><span class="f2">Easterling of</span></span> Barrett's Orchards. She was accompanied by her <span class="app" id="app-7168k39"><span class="f1">friend,</span><span class="f2">friend</span></span> Mrs. Irene Deorsey, also of <span class="app" id="app-7232l60"><span class="f1">Barret's</span><span class="f2">Barrett's</span></span> Orchards, who had shopped the video store without finding anything she wanted to rent. <span class="app" id="app-6976b35"><span class="f1">"So</span><span class="f2">Too</span></span> much <span class="app" id="app-7296a27"><span class="f1">violence," she told her friend Esther, who agreed. Esther Easterling was seventy-three years old,</span><span class="f2">violence,</span></span> Irene <span class="app" id="app-7360c51"><span class="f1">Deorsey seventy-one.</span><span class="f2">said.</span></span> Both <span class="app" id="z-2832"><span class="f2">women</span></span> were cigarette widows.
Esther could hardly have missed the orange Public Works <span class="app" id="app-7168l13"><span class="f1">dumptruck</span><span class="f2">dump truck</span></span> coming down the hill; although she denied this to the police, to the newspaper, and to me when I talked to her some two months later, I think it likely that she just forgot to look.<span class="app" id="z-1968"><span class="f1">I have never held this against her.</span></span> As my own mother (another cigarette <span class="app" id="app-7360b45"><span class="f1">widow, now that I think of it; the woods are full of them)</span><span class="f2">widow)</span></span> used to say, "The two most common ailments of the elderly are arthritis and <span class="app" id="app-7296e62"><span class="f1">stupidity.</span><span class="f2">forgetfulness.</span></span> They can be held responsible for neither."
Driving the Public Works truck was <span class="app" id="app-7232e20"><span class="f1">an</span><span class="f2">William Fraker, of Old Cape.</span></span> Mr. Fraker was thirty-eight years old on the day of my wife's death, driving with his shirt <span class="app" id="app-7424"><span class="f1">off, smoking a cigarette,</span><span class="f2">off</span></span> and thinking how badly he wanted a cool shower and a cold beer, not necessarily in that order. He and three other men had spent <span class="app" id="app-7168b44"><span class="f1">the day</span><span class="f2">eight hours</span></span> putting down asphalt patch out on the Harris Avenue Extension near the airport, a hot job on a hot day, and Bill Fraker <span class="app" id="app-7360c59"><span class="f1">guessed</span><span class="f2">said yeah,</span></span> he <span class="app" id="app-7296t59"><span class="f1">had probably lost three pounds at least to plain old dehydration. He was on his way back to the town garage with the truck, which was empty. Had it still been full of asphalt and a thousand pounds heavier, I think Esther and Irene would very likely</span><span class="f2">might</span></span> have <span class="app" id="z-8304v22"><span class="f1">joined their husbands in the afterworld. </span></span>
<span class="app" id="app-7360z53"><span class="f1">Bill Fraker was</span><span class="f2">been</span></span> going a little too <span class="app" id="app-7168h81"><span class="f1">fast, he admitted that— perhaps</span><span class="f2">fast—maybe</span></span> forty in a <span class="app" id="app-7232j16"><span class="f1">thirty mile an hour</span><span class="f2">thirty-mile-an-hour</span></span> zone. He was <span class="app" id="app-7488x48"><span class="f1">anxious</span><span class="f2">eager</span></span> to get back to the garage, sign off on the truck, and get behind the wheel of his own F-150, which had air conditioning. Also, the dump truck's brakes, while good enough to pass inspection, were a long way from tip-top condition. Fraker hit them as soon as he saw the<span class="app" id="z-8496j72"><span class="f1">blue</span></span> Toyota pull out in front of him (he hit his horn, as well), but it was too late. He heard screaming tires—his own, and Esther's as she belatedly realized her danger—and saw her face for just a moment.
"That was the worst part, somehow," he told me as we sat on his porch, drinking beers—it was October by then, and although the sun was warm on our faces, we were both wearing sweaters. "You know how high up you sit in one of those <span class="app" id="app-7552"><span class="f1">dump-trucks?"</span><span class="f2">dump trucks?"</span></span>
I nodded.
"Well, she was looking up to see me—craning up, you'd say—and the sun was full in her face. I could see how old she was. I remember thinking, 'Holy shit, she's gonna break like glass if I can't stop.' But old people are tough, more often than not. They can surprise you. I mean, look at how it turned out, both those old biddies still alive, and your wife..."
He stopped then, bright red color dashing into his cheeks, making him look like a boy who has been laughed at in the schoolyard by girls who have noticed his fly is unzipped. It was comical, but if I'd smiled, it only would have confused him.
"Mr. Noonan, I'm sorry. My mouth just sort of ran away with me."
"It's all right," I told him. "I'm over the worst of it, anyway." That was a lie,<span class="app" id="z-8640c62"><span class="f1">of course,</span></span> but it put us back on track.
"Anyway," he said, "we hit. There was a loud bang, and a crumping sound when the driver's side of the car caved in. Breaking glass, too. I was thrown against the wheel hard enough so I couldn't draw a breath without it hurting for a week or more, and I had a big<span class="app" id="z-8736"><span class="f1">circular</span></span> bruise right here." He drew an arc on his chest just below the collarbones. "I banged my head on the windshield hard enough to crack the glass, but all I got up there was a little purple knob...no bleeding, not even a headache. My wife says I've just got a naturally thick skull. I saw the woman driving the Toyota, Mrs. Easterling, thrown across the console between the front bucket seats. Then we were finally stopped, all tangled together in the middle of the street, and I got out to see how bad they were. I tell you, I expected to find them both dead."
Neither of them <span class="app" id="app-7488u38"><span class="f1">were</span><span class="f2">was</span></span> dead, neither of them <span class="app" id="app-7680"><span class="f1">were</span><span class="f2">was</span></span> even unconscious, although Mrs. Easterling had three broken ribs and a dislocated hip. Mrs. Deorsey, who had been a seat away from the impact, suffered a concussion when she rapped her head on her window. That was all; she was "treated and released at Home Hospital," as the Derry News always puts it in such cases.
My wife, the former Johanna Arlen of <span class="app" id="app-7232e62"><span class="f1">Kittery,</span><span class="f2">Malden, Massachusetts,</span></span> saw it all from where she stood outside the <span class="app" id="app-7168l60"><span class="f1">drug store,</span><span class="f2">drugstore,</span></span> with her purse slung over her shoulder and her prescription bag in one hand. Like Bill Fraker, she <span class="app" id="z-8688o77"><span class="f2">must have</span></span> thought the occupants of the Toyota <span class="app" id="app-7616l46"><span class="f1">must</span><span class="f2">were</span></span> either<span class="app" id="z-8544z52"><span class="f1">be</span></span> dead or seriously hurt. The sound of the <span class="app" id="app-7168g33"><span class="f1">collison</span><span class="f2">collision</span></span> had been a hollow, authoritative bang which rolled through the hot afternoon air like a bowling ball down an alley. The sound of breaking glass <span class="app" id="app-7232z43"><span class="f1">surrounded</span><span class="f2">edged</span></span> it like jagged lace. The two vehicles were tangled violently together in the middle of Jackson Street, the dirty orange truck looming over the <span class="app" id="app-7488b36"><span class="f1">pale blue</span><span class="f2">pale-blue</span></span> import like a bullying parent over a cowering child.
Johanna began to sprint across the parking lot toward the street. Others were doing the same all around her. One of them, Miss Jill Dunbarry, had been window-shopping at Radio Shack when the accident occurred. She said she thought she remembered running past <span class="app" id="app-7744s78"><span class="f1">Johanna--she</span><span class="f2">Johanna—at least she</span></span> was pretty sure she remembered someone in <span class="app" id="app-7616w18"><span class="f1">blue slacks, at feasteour</span><span class="f2">yellow slacks—but</span></span> she couldn't be sure. By then, Mrs. Easterling was screaming that she was hurt, they were both hurt, wouldn't somebody help her and her friend Irene.
Halfway across the parking lot, near a little cluster of newspaper dispensers, my wife fell down. Her purse-strap stayed over her shoulder, but her prescription bag slipped from her hand, and the <span class="app" id="app-7168i36"><span class="f1">plastic bottle inside shattered.</span><span class="f2">sinus inhaler slid halfway out.</span></span> The <span class="app" id="app-7232e55"><span class="f1">top of the bag was rolled down, though, and all the pills</span><span class="f2">other item</span></span> stayed <span class="app" id="app-7488x26"><span class="f1">in it. I could have used them myself, if I'd ever had sinus problems.</span><span class="f2">put.</span></span>
No one noticed <span class="app" id="app-7744g83"><span class="f1">the lady</span><span class="f2">her</span></span> lying <span class="app" id="app-7616i91"><span class="f1">in the parking lot</span><span class="f2">there</span></span> by the newspaper dispensers; <span class="app" id="app-7168p34"><span class="f1">they were</span><span class="f2">everyone was</span></span> focused on the tangled vehicles, the screaming women, the spreading puddle of water and antifreeze from the <span class="app" id="app-7232k34"><span class="f1">public works</span><span class="f2">Public Works</span></span> truck's ruptured radiator. ("That's gas!" the clerk from Fast Foto shouted to anyone who would listen. "That's gas, watch out she don't blow, fellas!") <span class="app" id="app-7488w68"><span class="f1">One</span><span class="f2">I suppose one</span></span> or two of the would-be rescuers might have jumped right over her, perhaps thinking she had fainted. To <span class="app" id="app-7744g84"><span class="f1">think</span><span class="f2">assume</span></span> such a thing on a day when the temperature was pushing ninety-five degrees would not have been unreasonable.
Roughly two dozen people from the shopping center clustered around the accident; another four dozen or so came running over from Strawford Park, where a baseball game had been going on. I imagine that all the things you would expect to hear in such situations were said, many of them more than once.<span class="app" id="z-8928c56"><span class="f1">Bill Fraker was trying to get to the crumpled Toyota; he would have been saying Are they all right? Are they all right? Somebody (perhaps several somebodies) would have laid kindly hands on him and tried to lead him away. You better sit down, mister, is what these folks would have found in their scripts, along with You don't look so good, of course. Someone would have said You better not move to Esther Easterling and/or Irene Deorsey; someone else would have advised Just sit still. The fellow (or gal) with the Bee belief in the Power of Positive Thinking would be saying You're all right, you're all right in tones of gruff reassurance, and several someones would be yelling Somebody call an ambulance!</span></span> Milling around. Someone reaching through the <span class="app" id="app-7488l54"><span class="f1">misshap:</span><span class="f2">misshapen</span></span> hole which had been the <span class="app" id="app-7232o36"><span class="f1">driver's side</span><span class="f2">driver's-side</span></span> window to pat Esther's<span class="app" id="z-8976m65"><span class="f1">gnarled,</span></span> trembling old hand. People immediately giving way for Joe Wyzer; at such moments anyone in a white coat automatically becomes the belle of the ball. In the distance, the warble of an ambulance siren rising like shaky air over an <span class="app" id="app-7488t18"><span class="f1">incinerator, and once more the Greek chorus saying what the Greek chorus always says in such situations: Thank God and Here it comes and I can hear it and Finally.</span><span class="f2">incinerator.</span></span>
All during this, lying unnoticed in the parking lot, was my wife with her purse still over her shoulder (inside, still wrapped in foil, her uneaten <span class="app" id="app-7744k77"><span class="f1">"sundry")</span><span class="f2">chocolate-marshmallow mouse)</span></span> and her white<span class="app" id="z-8880p99"><span class="f1">paper</span></span> prescription bag near one outstretched hand. It was Joe Wyzer, hurrying back to the pharmacy to get a compress for Irene Deorsey's head, who spotted her. He recognized her even <span class="app" id="z-9120e46"><span class="f2">though she was</span></span> lying face-down. He recognized her by her red hair, white blouse, and <span class="app" id="app-7872q49"><span class="f1">blue</span><span class="f2">yellow</span></span> slacks. He recognized her because he had waited on her not fifteen minutes before.
"Mrs. Noonan?" he asked, forgetting all about the compress for the dazed but apparently not too badly hurt Irene Deorsey. "Mrs. Noonan, are you all right?" Knowing already (or so I suspect; perhaps I am wrong) that she was not.
He turned her over. It took both hands to do it, and even then he had to work hard, kneeling and pushing and lifting there in the parking lot with the heat baking down from above and then bouncing back up from the asphalt. Dead people put on weight, it seems to me; both in their flesh and in our minds, they put on weight.
<span class="app" id="app-7232f80"><span class="f1">Her face was burned.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-8400u52"><span class="f2">There were red marks on her face.</span></span> When I <span class="app" id="app-7872c53"><span class="f1">identfied her,</span><span class="f2">identified her</span></span> I could see <span class="app" id="app-7488w12"><span class="f1">the scorches on her forehead and chin</span><span class="f2">them clearly</span></span> even on the video monitor. I started to ask the assistant medical examiner what they were, but then I <span class="app" id="z-8784q41"><span class="f1"> knew...just as I knew I might vomit before much longer.</span><span class="f2"> knew.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="app-7872f55"><span class="f1">Mid-August,</span><span class="f2">Late August,</span></span> hot pavement, elementary, my dear Watson. <span class="app" id="app-7232p61"><span class="f1">The marks on her forehead and chin were no different than the ones you see on</span><span class="f2">My wife died getting</span></span> a <span class="app" id="app-7936j21"><span class="f1">steak when you take it off the grille. During the five minutes or so she had lain unnoticed on the pavement, she had not just been dying; she had been cooking.</span><span class="f2">sunburn.</span></span>
Wyzer got up, saw that the ambulance had arrived, and ran toward it. He pushed his way through the crowd and grabbed one of the attendants as he got out from behind the wheel. <span class="app" id="app-7488w47"><span class="f1">"There</span><span class="f2">"There's a</span></span> woman over there," Wyzer <span class="app" id="app-7872h80"><span class="f1">xe</span><span class="f2">said,</span></span> pointing toward the parking lot.
"Guy, we've got two women right here, and a man as <span class="app" id="app-7232c70"><span class="f1">wel ve</span><span class="f2">well,"</span></span> the attendant said. He tried to pull away, but Wyzer held on.
"Never mind them right now," he said. "They're basically okay. The woman over there isn't."
The woman over there was<span class="app" id="z-8592k78"><span class="f1">almost certainly</span></span> dead, and I'm pretty sure Joe Wyzer knew <span class="app" id="app-7872p79"><span class="f1">it even then...but</span><span class="f2">it . . . but</span></span> he had his priorities straight. Give him that. And he was convincing enough to get both paramedics moving away from the tangle of truck and Toyota, in spite of Esther Easterling's cries of pain and the rumbles of protest from the Greek chorus.
When they got to my wife, one of the paramedics was quick to confirm what Joe Wyzer had already suspected. "Holy shit," the other one said. "What happened to her?"
"Heart, most likely," the first one said. "She got excited and it just blew out on <span class="app" id="app-7936c90"><span class="f1">her. Happens all the time."</span><span class="f2">her."</span></span>
But it wasn't her heart. The autopsy revealed a brain <span class="app" id="app-8064e96"><span class="f1">anyurism</span><span class="f2">aneurysm</span></span> which she might have been living with, all unknown, for <span class="app" id="z-9024"><span class="f2">as long as five years. As she sprinted across the parking lot toward the accident, that weak vessel in her cerebral cortex had blown like a tire, drowning her control-centers in blood and killing her. Death had probably not been instantaneous, the assistant medical</span></span> examiner told me, but it had still come swiftly enough...and she wouldn't have suffered. Just one big black nova, all sensation and thought gone even before she hit the pavement.
<span class="app" id="app-7872j93"><span class="f1">The autopsy revealed something else, as well, something which</span><span class="f2">"Can</span></span> I <span class="app" id="app-7488z53"><span class="f1">believe was then revealed to me by oversight...certainly there was no need for me to know, at least</span><span class="f2">help you</span></span> in <span class="app" id="app-7936o30"><span class="f1">their view. At</span><span class="f2">any way, Mr. Noonan?"</span></span> the <span class="app" id="app-8064n80"><span class="f1">time of her death</span><span class="f2">assistant ME asked, turning me gently away from the still face and closed eyes on the video monitor. "Do you have questions? I'll answer them if I can."</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-9408w75"><span class="f2">"Just one," I said. I told him what she'd purchased</span></span> in the <span class="app" id="app-7232y39"><span class="f1">Rite Aid parking lot, Jo had been six weeks pregnant.</span><span class="f2">drugstore just before she died. Then I asked my question.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-9216c70"><span class="f2">*   *   *</span></span>
The days leading up to the funeral and the funeral itself are dreamlike in my memory—the clearest memory I have is of eating Jo's chocolate <span class="app" id="app-7872t87"><span class="f1">"sundry"</span><span class="f2">mouse</span></span> and crying...crying mostly, I think, because I knew how soon the taste of it would be gone. I had one other crying fit a few days after we buried her, and I will tell you about that one shortly.
<span class="app" id="z-9168f86"><span class="f2">I was glad for the arrival of Jo's family, and particularly for the arrival of her oldest brother, Frank. It was Frank Arlen—fifty, red-cheeked, portly, and with a head of lush dark hair—who organized the arrangements . . . who wound up actually dickering with the funeral director.</span></span>
"I can't believe you did that," I said later, as we sat in a booth at Jack's Pub, drinking beers.
"He was trying to stick it to you, Mikey," he said. "I hate guys like that." He reached into his back pocket, brought out a handkerchief, and wiped absently at his cheeks with it. He hadn't broken down—none of the Arlens broke down, at least not <span class="app" id="app-7936y81"><span class="f1">where</span><span class="f2">when</span></span> I <span class="app" id="app-8064b83"><span class="f1">could see them do it-but</span><span class="f2">was with them—but</span></span> Frank had leaked steadily all day; he looked like a man suffering from severe conjunctivitis.
There had been six Arlen sibs in all, Jo the youngest and the only girl. She had been the pet of her big brothers. I suspect that if I'd had anything to do with her death, the five of them would have torn me apart with their bare hands. As it was, they formed a protective shield around me instead, and that was good.<span class="app" id="z-9264h82"><span class="f1">Wonderful, in fact.</span></span> I suppose I <span class="app" id="app-8064u59"><span class="f1">would</span><span class="f2">might</span></span> have muddled through <span class="app" id="z-9456y42"><span class="f2">without them, but I don't know how. I was thirty-six, remember. You don't expect to have to bury your wife when you're thirty-six and she herself is two years younger. Death was the last thing on our minds.</span></span>
"If a guy gets caught taking your stereo out of your car, <span class="app" id="app-7936m78"><span class="f1">north from Massachusetts</span><span class="f2">they call it theft and put him</span></span> in <span class="app" id="app-7872v28"><span class="f1">the sixties,</span><span class="f2">jail," Frank said.

Greedy asshole, I fed him his lunch, didn't I?"
"Yes. You did."
"You okay, Mikey?"
"I'm okay."
"Sincerely okay?"
"How the fuck should I know?" I asked him, loud enough to turn some heads in a nearby booth. <span class="app" id="app-7936d65"><span class="f1">"Call</span><span class="f2">And then: "She was pregnant."</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-9552"><span class="f2">His face grew very still. "What?"</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-9696s47"><span class="f2">I struggled to keep my voice down. "Pregnant. Six or seven weeks, according to the . . . you know, the autopsy. Did you know? Did she tell you?"</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-9744l86"><span class="f2">"No! Christ, no!" But there was a funny look on his face, as if she had told him something. "I knew you were trying, of course . . . she said you had a low sperm count and</span></span> it <span class="app" id="app-7872u38"><span class="f1">theft</span><span class="f2">might take a little while, but the doctor thought you guys'd probably . . . sooner or later you'd probably . . ." He trailed off, looking down at his hands. "They can tell that, huh? They check for that?"</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-9360g17"><span class="f2">"They can tell. As for checking, I don't know if they do it automatically or not. I asked."</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-9840"><span class="f2">"Why?"</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-9888"><span class="f2">"She didn't just buy sinus medicine before she died. She also bought one of those home pregnancy-testing kits."</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-9936"><span class="f2">"You had no idea? No clue?"</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-9984"><span class="f1">and put him in jail," Frank</span><span class="f2">I shook my head.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-32"><span class="f2">He reached across the table and squeezed my shoulder. "She wanted to be sure, that's all. You know that, don't you?"</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-8832g29"><span class="f2">A refill on my sinus medicine and a piece of fish, she'd</span></span> said. <span class="app" id="app-7232h75"><span class="f1">The Arlens</span><span class="f2">Looking like always.

We</span></span> had <span class="app" id="app-8064u21"><span class="f1">cone ee .</span><span class="f2">been trying to have a kid for eight years, but she had looked just like always.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-9312"><span class="f2">"Sure," I said, patting Frank's hand. "Sure, big guy. I know."</span></span>

<span class="app" id="z-224"><span class="f2">It was the Arlens—led by Frank—who handled Johanna's sendoff. As the writer of the family, I was assigned the obituary. My brother came up from Virginia with my mom and my aunt and was allowed to tend the guest-book at the viewings. My mother—almost completely ga-ga at the age of sixty-six, although the doctors refused to call it Alzheimer's—lived in Memphis with her sister, two years younger and only slightly less wonky. They were in charge of cutting the cake and the pies at the funeral reception.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-272"><span class="f2">Everything else was arranged by the Arlens, from the viewing hours to the components of the funeral ceremony. Frank and Victor, the second-youngest brother, spoke brief tributes. Jo's dad</span></span> offered a prayer for <span class="app" id="app-7936p13"><span class="f1">t</span><span class="f2">his daughter's soul. And at the end, Pete</span></span> Breedlove, the boy who cut <span class="app" id="app-7872r69"><span class="f1">ae passin</span><span class="f2">our grass in</span></span> the <span class="app" id="app-8128g57"><span class="f1">fate:</span><span class="f2">summer</span></span> and raked our yard in the fall, brought everyone to <span class="app" id="app-7232j85"><span class="f1">co</span><span class="f2">tears</span></span> by singing "Blessed Assurance," which Frank said had been Jo's favorite hymn as a girl. How Frank found Pete and persuaded him to sing at the funeral is something I never found out.
We got through it—the afternoon and evening viewings on <span class="app" id="app-7936c53"><span class="f1">Tuesday (although why people want to come to a funeral chapel and stare at a closed coffin while their noses and throats fill with the Hoying aroma of too many flowers is beyond me),</span><span class="f2">Tuesday,</span></span> the funeral service on Wednesday morning, then the little pray-over at Fairlawn Cemetery. What I remember <span class="app" id="app-7872i72"><span class="f1">mostly</span><span class="f2">most</span></span> was thinking how hot it was, how lost I felt without having Jo to talk to, and that I wished I had bought a new pair of shoes. Jo would have pestered me to death about the ones I was <span class="app" id="app-8128n78"><span class="f1">wearing</span><span class="f2">wearing,</span></span> if <span class="app" id="app-7232b88"><span class="f1">she'd seen them.</span><span class="f2">she had been there.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-9504"><span class="f2">Later on I talked to my brother, Sid, told him we had to do something about our mother and Aunt Francine before the two of them disappeared completely into the Twilight Zone. They were too young</span></span> for a nursing <span class="app" id="app-8064g97"><span class="f1">Home Aten ard</span><span class="f2">home; what did</span></span> Sid advise?
He advised something,<span class="app" id="z-320"><span class="f1">I know he did,</span></span> but I'll be <span class="app" id="app-8064r65"><span class="f1">canes</span><span class="f2">damned</span></span> if I know what it was. I agreed to it, I remember that, but not what it was. Later that day, Siddy, our <span class="app" id="app-7232g32"><span class="f1">Mom,</span><span class="f2">mom,</span></span> and our aunt climbed <span class="app" id="app-7872q79"><span class="f1">nate</span><span class="f2">back</span></span> into Siddy's rental car for the drive to Boston, where they would spend the night and then grab the Southern Crescent the following day. My brother is happy enough to chaperone the old folks, but he doesn't fly, even if the tickets are on me. He claims there are no breakdown lanes in the <span class="app" id="app-8192w29"><span class="f1">sky,</span><span class="f2">sky</span></span> if the engine quits.
Most of the Arlens left the next day. Once more it was dog-hot, the sun glaring out of a white-haze sky and lying on everything like melted brass. They stood in front <span class="app" id="app-7936s85"><span class="f1">4</span><span class="f2">of</span></span> our house—which had become solely my house by then—with three taxis lined up at the <span class="app" id="app-8064e60"><span class="f1">curb,</span><span class="f2">curb behind them, big galoots</span></span> hugging one another amid the litter of tote-bags and saying their goodbyes in those foggy Massachusetts accents.
<span class="app" id="z-9648t24"><span class="f2">Frank stayed another day. We picked a big bunch of flowers behind the house—not those ghastly-smelling hothouse things whose aroma I always associate with death and organ-music but real flowers, the kind Jo liked best—and stuck them in a couple of</span></span> coffee cans I <span class="app" id="app-7232y76"><span class="f1">four</span><span class="f2">found</span></span> in the <span class="app" id="app-7872j50"><span class="f1">eel setae,</span><span class="f2">back pantry.</span></span> We went <span class="app" id="app-8192t15"><span class="f1">ont</span><span class="f2">out</span></span> to <span class="app" id="app-7936d25"><span class="f1">F 1: vn.</span><span class="f2">Fairlawn</span></span> and put them on the new grave. Then we just sat there for awhile under the beating sun.
"She was always just the sweetest thing in my life," Frank said at last in a strange, muffled voice. "We took care of Jo when we were kids. Us guys. No one messed with Jo, I'll tell you. Anyone tried, we'd feed em their <span class="app" id="app-8064v40"><span class="f1">lunc MY</span><span class="f2">lunch."</span></span>
"She told me a lot of stories."
"Good ones?"
"Yeah, real good."
"I'm going to miss her so much."
"Me, too," I said. <span class="app" id="app-7232f76"><span class="f1">"Me too."</span><span class="f2">"Frank . . . listen . . . I know you were her favorite brother. She never called you, maybe just to say that she missed a period or was feeling whoopsy in the morning? You can tell me. I won't be pissed."</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-128"><span class="f2">"But she didn't. Honest to God. Was she whoopsy in the morning?"</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-512"><span class="f2">"Not that I saw." And that was just it. I hadn't seen anything. Of course I'd been writing, and when I write I pretty much trance out. But she knew where I went in those trances. She could have found me and shaken me fully awake. Why hadn't she? Why would she hide good news? Not wanting to tell me until she was sure was plausible . . . but it somehow wasn't Jo.</span></span>
"Was it a boy or a girl?" he asked.
<span class="app" id="app-7872c68"><span class="f1">"The chap she was carrying?"</span><span class="f2">"A girl."</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-368"><span class="f2">We'd had names picked out and waiting for most of our marriage. A boy would have been Andrew. Our daughter would have been Kia. Kia Jane Noonan.</span></span>

Frank, divorced six years and on his own, <span class="app" id="app-8192k47"><span class="f1">hi</span><span class="f2">had been staying with</span></span> me. On our way back to the house he said, "I worry about you, Mikey. You haven't got much family to fall back on <span class="app" id="app-7936u11"><span class="f1">in</span><span class="f2">at</span></span> a time like this, and what you do have is far away."
"I'll be all right," I said.
He nodded. "That's what we say, anyway, isn't it?"
"We?"
"Guys. <span class="app" id="app-8064s70"><span class="f1">'I'll</span><span class="f2">‘I'll</span></span> be all right.' And if we're not, we try to make sure no <span class="app" id="app-7232j66"><span class="f1">onelncns</span><span class="f2">one knows</span></span> it." He looked at me, eyes still leaking, handkerchief in one big sunburned hand. "If you're not all right, Mikey, and you don't want to call your <span class="app" id="app-7872a39"><span class="f1">brother, let</span><span class="f2">brother—I saw the way you looked at him—let</span></span> me be your brother. For Jo's sake if not your own."
"Okay," I said, respecting and appreciating the offer, also knowing I would do no such thing. I don't call people for help. It's not because of the way I was raised, at least I don't think so; it's <span class="app" id="z-416"><span class="f2">the way I was made. Johanna once said that if I was drowning at Dark Score Lake, where we have a summer home, I would die silently fifty feet out from the public beach rather than yell for help. It's not a question of love or affection. I can give those and I can</span></span> take them. I feel pain like <span class="app" id="app-7936d96"><span class="f1">Hee Tmeed tol</span><span class="f2">anyone else. I need to</span></span> touch <span class="app" id="app-8064q81"><span class="f1">andibe</span><span class="f2">and be</span></span> touched. But if someone asks me, "Are you all right?" I can't answer no. I can't say help me.
A couple of hours <span class="app" id="app-7232k90"><span class="f1">later,</span><span class="f2">later</span></span> Frank left for the southern end of the state. When he opened the car door, I was touched to see that the taped book he was listening to was one of mine. He hugged me, then surprised me with a kiss on the mouth, a good hard smack. "If you need to talk, call," he said. "And if you need to be with someone, <span class="app" id="app-7872d27"><span class="f1">Mikey, don't bother to call. Just</span><span class="f2">just</span></span> come."
I nodded.
"And be careful."
That startled me. The combination of heat and grief had made me feel as if I had been living in a dream for the last few days, but that got through.<span class="app" id="z-9792"><span class="f1">"Careful?" I asked him.</span></span>
"Careful of what?"
<span class="app" id="z-80"><span class="f2">"I don't know," he said. "I don't know, Mikey." Then he got into his car—he was so big and it was so little that he looked as if he were wearing it—and drove away. The sun was going down by then. Do you know how the sun looks at the end of a hot day in</span></span> August, all orange and somehow squashed, <span class="app" id="app-7936m70"><span class="f1">a</span><span class="f2">as</span></span> if an invisible <span class="app" id="app-8064x53"><span class="f1">hana was</span><span class="f2">hand were</span></span> pushing down on the top of it and at any moment it might just pop like <span class="app" id="app-8192l15"><span class="f1">a</span><span class="f2">an overfilled</span></span> mosquito and splatter all over the horizon? It was like that. In the east, where it was already dark, thunder was rumbling. But there was no rain that night, only a dark that came down as thick and stifling as a blanket. All the same, I slipped in front of the word processor and wrote for an hour or so. It went pretty well, as I remember. And you know, even when it doesn't, it passes the time.

My <span class="app" id="app-7232d22"><span class="f1">Peron</span><span class="f2">second</span></span> crying fit came three or four days after the funeral. That sense of being in a dream persisted—I walked, I talked, I answered the phone, I worked on my<span class="app" id="z-464"><span class="f1">new</span></span> book, which had been about eighty <span class="app" id="app-8192l27"><span class="f1">per cent</span><span class="f2">percent</span></span> complete when Jo died—but all the time there was this clear sense of <span class="app" id="app-7872m39"><span class="f1">disconnected cluelessness,</span><span class="f2">disconnection,</span></span> a feeling that <span class="app" id="app-8256"><span class="f1">iealdne</span><span class="f2">everything was going on at a distance from the real me, that I was more or less phoning it in.</span></span>

At the end of the six hours, I wanted the job done. And if it wasn't, I told her, it would be done, anyway.
"Mr. Noonan, that's far too much," she said.
"Maybe and maybe not, but it's what I'm paying," I said. "Will you do it?"
She said she would, of course she would.

Johanna and I had <span class="app" id="z-8208"><span class="f2">both</span></span> been English majors at the University of Maine, and like many <span class="app" id="app-7232f16"><span class="f1">others of our ilk,</span><span class="f2">others,</span></span> I <span class="app" id="app-8384k88"><span class="f1">suppose,</span><span class="f2">reckon,</span></span> we fell in love to the sound of Shakespeare and the Tilbury Town cynicism of <span class="app" id="app-8448s10"><span class="f1">Edward</span><span class="f2">Edwin</span></span> Arlington Robinson. Yet the writer <span class="app" id="app-8064v75"><span class="f1">which</span><span class="f2">who</span></span> had bound us closest together was no college-friendly poet or essayist but W. Somerset <span class="app" id="app-8192y93"><span class="f1">Maughm,</span><span class="f2">Maugham,</span></span> that <span class="app" id="app-7232z19"><span class="f1">elderly,</span><span class="f2">elderly</span></span> globetrotting novelist-playwright with the reptile's face (always obscured by cigarette smoke in his <span class="app" id="app-8384v32"><span class="f1">photoeranhe</span><span class="f2">photographs,</span></span> it seems) and the romantic's heart. So it did not surprise me much to find that the <span class="app" id="app-8448o27"><span class="f1">story Jo had been reading at</span><span class="f2">book under</span></span> the <span class="app" id="app-8064t69"><span class="f1">time of her death in a shopping center parking lot</span><span class="f2">bed</span></span> was The Moon and Sixpence. <span class="app" id="app-8192a81"><span class="f1">Probaby</span><span class="f2">I had read it myself as a late teenager,</span></span> not <span class="app" id="app-7232h34"><span class="f1">just reading</span><span class="f2">once</span></span> but <span class="app" id="app-8384z69"><span class="f1">rereading, although I couldn't recall ever seeing her</span><span class="f2">twice, identifying passionately</span></span> with <span class="app" id="app-8448z76"><span class="f1">this one before.</span><span class="f2">the character of Charles Strickland. (It was writing</span></span> I <span class="app" id="z-8688u21"><span class="f2">wanted to do in the South Seas, of course, not painting.)</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-8832n65"><span class="f2">She</span></span> had <span class="app" id="app-8064y39"><span class="f1">myself</span><span class="f2">been using a playing card from some defunct deck as her place-marker, and as I opened the book, I thought of something</span></span> she had said when I was first getting to know her. In <span class="app" id="app-8192q32"><span class="f1">Twentieth Century</span><span class="f2">Twentieth-Century</span></span> British Lit, this had been, probably in 1980. Johanna Arlen had been a fiery little sophomore. I was a senior, picking up the <span class="app" id="app-7232f97"><span class="f1">Twentieth Century</span><span class="f2">Twentieth-Century</span></span> Brits simply because I had time on my hands that last semester. "A hundred years from now," she had said, "the shame of the <span class="app" id="app-8384l35"><span class="f1">mid-twentieth century</span><span class="f2">mid-twentieth-century</span></span> literary critics will be that they embraced Lawrence and ignored <span class="app" id="app-8448w77"><span class="f1">Maughm."</span><span class="f2">Maugham."</span></span> This was greeted with contemptuously good-natured laughter (they all knew Women in Love was one of the greatest damn books ever written), but I didn't laugh. I fell in love.
The playing card marked pages 102 and <span class="app" id="app-8064e18"><span class="f1">103 Dirk</span><span class="f2">103—Dirk</span></span> Stroeve has just discovered that his wife has left him for Strickland, <span class="app" id="app-8192l88"><span class="f1">Maughm's</span><span class="f2">Maugham's</span></span> version of Paul <span class="app" id="app-7232q44"><span class="f1">Gaugan...although it was always t Allace Stevens that Strickland really reminded me of.</span><span class="f2">Gauguin.</span></span> The <span class="app" id="z-8352"><span class="f2">narrator tries to buck Stroeve up. My dear fellow, don't be unhappy. She'll come back . . .</span></span>
"Easy for you to <span class="app" id="app-8384x72"><span class="f1">say, hom</span><span class="f2">say," I murmured to the room which</span></span> now belonged just to me.
I turned <span class="app" id="app-8448l96"><span class="f1">ee</span><span class="f2">the</span></span> page <span class="app" id="app-8064j64"><span class="f1">ng</span><span class="f2">and</span></span> read this: Strickland's <span class="app" id="app-8192y18"><span class="f1">frig</span><span class="f2">injurious</span></span> calm robbed <span class="app" id="app-7232e17"><span class="f1">grome</span><span class="f2">Stroeve</span></span> of his self-control. Blind rage seized him, and without knowing what he was doing he flung himself on Strickland. Strickland was taken by surprise and he staggered, but he was very strong, even after his illness, and in a moment, he did not exactly know how, Stroeve found himself on the floor.
<span class="app" id="app-8384x54"><span class="f1">'You</span><span class="f2">"You</span></span> funny little <span class="app" id="app-8448c38"><span class="f1">man,'</span><span class="f2">man,"</span></span> said Strickland.
It occurred to me that Jo was never going to turn the page and hear Strickland call the pathetic Stroeve a funny little man. <span class="app" id="app-8064d61"><span class="f1">Ina</span><span class="f2">In a</span></span> moment of brilliant epiphany I have never forgotten—how could I? it <span class="app" id="app-8192t27"><span class="f1">Aas</span><span class="f2">was</span></span> one of the <span class="app" id="app-7232j98"><span class="f1">clearest</span><span class="f2">worst</span></span> moments of my <span class="app" id="app-8384u27"><span class="f1">life—-I</span><span class="f2">life—I</span></span> understood it wasn't a mistake that would be rectified, or a dream from which I would awaken. Johanna was dead.
<span class="app" id="app-8448w24"><span class="f1">All</span><span class="f2">My</span></span> strength <span class="app" id="app-8064p92"><span class="f1">ran out of me.</span><span class="f2">was robbed by grief.</span></span> If the bed hadn't been there, I would have fallen to the floor. We weep from our eyes, it's all we <span class="app" id="z-8496c68"><span class="f2">can do, but on that evening I felt as if every pore of my body were weeping, every crack and cranny. I sat there on her side of the bed, with her dusty paperback copy of The Moon and Sixpence in my hand, and I wailed. I think it was surprise as much as pain; in spite of the corpse I had seen and identified on a high-resolution video monitor, in spite of the funeral and Pete Breedlove singing "Blessed Assurance" in his high, sweet tenor voice, in spite of the graveside</span></span> service with its ashes to ashes and dust to dust, I hadn't really believed it. The Penguin paperback did <span class="app" id="z-8976p32"><span class="f2">for me</span></span> what the <span class="app" id="app-8192z24"><span class="f1">thirty-five-hundred dollar grey</span><span class="f2">big gray</span></span> coffin had not: it<span class="app" id="z-8928t26"><span class="f1">first</span></span> insisted she was <span class="app" id="app-8064c21"><span class="f1">dead and then swallowed her whole.</span><span class="f2">dead.</span></span>
You funny little man, said Strickland.
I lay back on our bed, crossed my forearms over my face, and<span class="app" id="z-8448"><span class="f1">wept. I</span></span> cried myself to <span class="app" id="app-8192d90"><span class="f1">sleep,</span><span class="f2">sleep that way</span></span> as children do when they're <span class="app" id="app-8512r80"><span class="f1">unhappy, bl in that sleep</span><span class="f2">unhappy.</span></span> I had an awful dream. <span class="app" id="app-8448c56"><span class="f1">I dreamed that</span><span class="f2">In it</span></span> I woke up, saw the paperback<span class="app" id="z-8592i57"><span class="f1">edition</span></span> of The Moon and Sixpence still lying on the coverlet beside me, and decided to put it back under the bed where I had found it.<span class="app" id="z-9168h99"><span class="f1">God knows why.</span></span> You know how confused dreams <span class="app" id="app-8640k39"><span class="f1">Assurance" in his sweet tenor's voice, in spite</span><span class="f2">are—logic like Dalí clocks gone so soft they lie over the branches</span></span> of <span class="app" id="z-9120b34"><span class="f2">trees like throw-rugs.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-9264g59"><span class="f2">I put</span></span> the <span class="app" id="app-8512g40"><span class="f1">graveside</span><span class="f2">playing-card bookmark back between pages 102 and 103—a turn of the index finger away from You funny little man, said</span></span> Strickland <span class="app" id="app-8192o82"><span class="f1">or</span><span class="f2">now</span></span> and forever—and rolled <span class="app" id="app-8448p39"><span class="f1">over on</span><span class="f2">onto</span></span> my side, <span class="app" id="z-9216p93"><span class="f2">hanging my head over the edge of the bed,</span></span> meaning to put the book back exactly where I had found it.<span class="app" id="z-9360s92"><span class="f1">,</span></span>
Jo was lying <span class="app" id="app-8704p49"><span class="f1">under the bed</span><span class="f2">there</span></span> amid the dust-kitties. A strand of cobweb hung down <span class="app" id="app-8192k23"><span class="f1">reer</span><span class="f2">from</span></span> the bottom of the box spring and caressed her cheek like a feather. Her red hair looked dull, but her eyes were dark and alert and baleful in her white face. And when she spoke, I knew that death had driven her insane.
"Give me that," she hissed. "It's my dust-catcher." She snatched <span class="app" id="app-8640w15"><span class="f1">The Moon and Sixpence</span><span class="f2">it</span></span> out of my hand before I could offer it to her. For a moment our fingers touched, and hers were as cold as twigs after a frost. She opened the book to her place, the playing card fluttering out, and placed Somerset <span class="app" id="app-8768"><span class="f1">Maughm</span><span class="f2">Maugham</span></span> over her face—a shroud of words. As she crossed her hands on her bosom and lay still, I realized she was wearing the blue dress I had <span class="app" id="z-8880b61"><span class="f2">buried her in. She had come out of her grave to hide under our bed.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-9456e12"><span class="f2">I awoke with a muffled cry and a painful jerk that almost tumbled</span></span> me off the side of the bed. I <span class="app" id="app-8448r13"><span class="f1">had</span><span class="f2">hadn't been asleep long—the</span></span> tears were still damp on my cheeks, and my eyelids <span class="app" id="app-8704a61"><span class="f1">eel cheney ee</span><span class="f2">had that funny</span></span> stretched feel they get after a bout of weeping. The <span class="app" id="app-8192a51"><span class="f1">vision of her rr that blue dress was</span><span class="f2">dream had been so</span></span> vivid<span class="app" id="z-8784n48"><span class="f1">enough upon awaking</span></span> that I had to roll on my side, hang my head down, and peer under the <span class="app" id="app-8704p97"><span class="f1">bed. For a moment I was</span><span class="f2">bed,</span></span> sure she would be there<span class="app" id="z-9408p53"><span class="f1">as I had dreamed her,</span></span> with the book over her face, that she would reach out with her <span class="app" id="app-8192v65"><span class="f1">waxy</span><span class="f2">cold</span></span> fingers <span class="app" id="app-8832"><span class="f1">and share her insanity like a bad cold.</span><span class="f2">to touch me.</span></span>
There was nothing there, of course—dreams are just dreams. <span class="app" id="app-8448x76"><span class="f1">And</span><span class="f2">Nevertheless,</span></span> I <span class="app" id="app-8896"><span class="f1">nad no intention of putting</span><span class="f2">spent</span></span> the <span class="app" id="app-8704o10"><span class="f1">book back where I had found it; Denise Breedlove or one</span><span class="f2">rest</span></span> of<span class="app" id="z-9600r70"><span class="f1">her friends would only find it, pull it out, and toss it in a box marked YARD SALE. </span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-9648m60"><span class="f1">And although</span></span> the<span class="app" id="z-9696d70"><span class="f1">dream's logic and terrifying clarity were beginning to fade, some of it must have remained, because that</span></span> night<span class="app" id="z-9744e97"><span class="f1">I slept</span></span> on the couch in my study. It was the right choice, I guess, because there were no more <span class="app" id="app-9088"><span class="f1">dreams. That I remember, at least;</span><span class="f2">dreams that night. Only</span></span> the nothingness of good sleep.</pre>
