<span class="app" id="app-34x4x0xc25"><span class="f1">In</span><span class="f2">And then there was the thing about</span></span> the <span class="app" id="z-4880u19"><span class="f2">books. It should have delighted him; instead, in some obscure way she did not understand, it seemed to have upset and depressed him. About three</span></span> months before that terrible <span class="app" id="app-3632"><span class="f1">night he</span><span class="f2">night, Stanley</span></span> had discovered that a childhood <span class="app" id="app-3504q96"><span class="f1">friend, Willam Denbrough (whom Stanley sometimes called "Stuttering Bill"),</span><span class="f2">friend of his</span></span> had turned out to be a <span class="app" id="z-7296"><span class="f2">writer—not a real</span></span> writer, <span class="app" id="app-3312v69"><span class="f1">and he</span><span class="f2">Patricia told her mother, but a novelist. The name on the books was William Denbrough, but Stanley had sometimes called him Stuttering Bill. He</span></span> had worked his way through almost all of <span class="app" id="app-3376o86"><span class="f1">Denbrough's books. ¶He had</span><span class="f2">the man's books; had, in fact,</span></span> been reading the last on the<span class="app" id="z-4304"><span class="f1">terrible</span></span> night of the <span class="app" id="app-3312q43"><span class="f1">bath, which happened to be</span><span class="f2">bath—the night of</span></span> May <span class="app" id="app-3504f63"><span class="f1">27th, 1983.</span><span class="f2">28th, 1985.</span></span> Patty <span class="app" id="app-3440m34"><span class="f1">Uris</span><span class="f2">herself</span></span> had picked up one of <span class="app" id="app-3696f19"><span class="f1">them</span><span class="f2">the earlier ones,</span></span> out of <span class="app" id="app-3376b70"><span class="f1">curiosity and</span><span class="f2">curiosity. She</span></span> had put it down after just three chapters.
<span class="app" id="app-3312r67"><span class="f1">"It was</span><span class="f2">It had not just been</span></span> a <span class="app" id="app-3504b40"><span class="f1">horrorbook,"</span><span class="f2">novel,</span></span> she told her mother <span class="app" id="app-3440t31"><span class="f1">later.</span><span class="f2">later; it had been a horrorbook. She said it just that way, all one word, the way she would have said sexbook. Patty was a sweet, kind woman, but not terribly articulate—she had wanted to tell her mother how much that book had frightened her and why it had upset her, but had not been able. "It was full of monsters," she said.</span></span> "Full of monsters <span class="app" id="app-3696u39"><span class="f1">and killings</span><span class="f2">chasing after little children. There were killings,</span></span> and...I don't <span class="app" id="app-3376l52"><span class="f1">know, the vlolence...It seemed</span><span class="f2">know...bad feelings and hurt. Stuff like that." It had, in fact, struck her as</span></span> almost <span class="app" id="app-3312v46"><span class="f1">pornographic to me. But</span><span class="f2">pornographic; that was the word which kept eluding her, probably because she had never in her life spoken it, although she knew what it meant. "But</span></span> Stan felt as if he'd rediscovered one of his childhood <span class="app" id="app-3440p33"><span class="f1">chums..."</span><span class="f2">chums... He talked about writing to him, but I knew he wouldn't.... I knew those stories made him feel bad, too...and...and..."</span></span>
And then <span class="app" id="app-3696g25"><span class="f1">she had begun</span><span class="f2">Patty Uris began</span></span> to cry.
That night, lacking roughly six months of being <span class="app" id="app-3376x53"><span class="f1">twenty-six</span><span class="f2">twenty-eight</span></span> years <span class="app" id="app-3312q81"><span class="f1">since</span><span class="f2">from</span></span> the day in 1957 when George Denbrough had met<span class="app" id="z-7392"><span class="f1"> a certain</span></span> Pennywise the Clown, Stanley and Patty<span class="app" id="z-7200"><span class="f1"> Uris</span></span> had been sitting in the den of their home in a suburb of <span class="app" id="app-3376j52"><span class="f1">Atlanta, Georgia.</span><span class="f2">Atlanta.</span></span> The <span class="app" id="app-3696s38"><span class="f1">television</span><span class="f2">TV</span></span> was <span class="app" id="app-3824"><span class="f1">on, and</span><span class="f2">on.</span></span> Patty was sitting in <span class="app" id="z-5552"><span class="f2">the love-seat in</span></span> front of it, dividing her attention between a pile of sewing and her favorite <span class="app" id="app-3760l14"><span class="f1">game show, which happened to be The Joker is Wild.</span><span class="f2">game-show, Family Feud.</span></span> She <span class="app" id="app-3376m99"><span class="f1">liked It</span><span class="f2">simply adored Richard Dawson and thought the watch-chain he always wore was terribly sexy, although wild horses would not have drawn this admission out of her. She also liked the show</span></span> because she<span class="app" id="z-4256"><span class="f1">knew</span></span> almost <span class="app" id="app-3760z63"><span class="f1">all</span><span class="f2">always got the most popular answers (there were no right answers on Family Feud, exactly; only</span></span> the <span class="app" id="app-3312j57"><span class="f1">answers.</span><span class="f2">most popular ones).</span></span> She had once asked Stan <span class="app" id="app-3696f20"><span class="f1">(who, although he had told her that Willam Denbrough had once been known In</span><span class="f2">why</span></span> the <span class="app" id="app-3888"><span class="f1">long-dead days of their Maine youth himself as Stuttering Bill, had neglected all these years</span><span class="f2">questions that seemed so easy</span></span> to<span class="app" id="z-4880f23"><span class="f1">tell</span></span> her <span class="app" id="app-3696f56"><span class="f1">that he had been known as Stanley Urine) why they gave</span><span class="f2">usually seemed so hard to</span></span> the <span class="app" id="app-3312e64"><span class="f1">contestants such easy questlons, and Stanley had replled:</span><span class="f2">families on the show.</span></span> "It's probably <span class="app" id="app-3376k61"><span class="f1">much</span><span class="f2">a lot</span></span> tougher <span class="app" id="z-6704"><span class="f2">when you're</span></span> up there under<span class="app" id="z-6992"><span class="f1">the lights, with</span></span> those <span class="app" id="app-3312y93"><span class="f1">cameras In your face.

"Everything's a lot tougher when it's for real. That's</span></span> when <span class="app" id="z-6800"><span class="f2">you choke. When</span></span> it's for real."
That was probably very true, she<span class="app" id="z-7088"><span class="f1">had</span></span> decided. Stanley had really fine insights into human nature sometimes. Much finer, she considered, than <span class="app" id="app-3376r65"><span class="f1">Stanley's</span><span class="f2">his</span></span> old friend <span class="app" id="app-3952t83"><span class="f1">Willam Debrough,</span><span class="f2">William Denbrough,</span></span> who had gotten rich<span class="app" id="z-7040"><span class="f1">by</span></span> writing a bunch of horrorbooks <span class="app" id="app-3376v37"><span class="f1">and appealing</span><span class="f2">which appealed</span></span> to people's baser natures.
Not that the Urises were doing <span class="app" id="z-6944"><span class="f2">so</span></span> badly <span class="app" id="app-4080c62"><span class="f1">themselves: the</span><span class="f2">themselves! The</span></span> suburb <span class="app" id="z-7136"><span class="f2">where they lived</span></span> was a fine one, and the home which they had purchased for 7,000 in <span class="app" id="app-3952j42"><span class="f1">fame</span><span class="f2">1979</span></span> would probably<span class="app" id="z-6848"><span class="f1">sell</span></span> now <span class="app" id="z-7328"><span class="f2">sell</span></span> quickly and painlessly for <span class="app" id="app-3x31cd2y69"><span class="f1">around</span></span> 65,000<span class="app" id="app-3312y69"><span class="f2">—not that she wanted to sell, but such things were good to know</span></span>.

Then the hate and<span class="app" id="z-8960"><span class="f1">the</span></span> shame would come flooding back like a <span class="app" id="app-4976y68"><span class="f1">ghastly migrane</span><span class="f2">migraine</span></span> headache<span class="app" id="z-8912"><span class="f1">of the soul</span></span> and she would <span class="app" id="app-4720j13"><span class="f1">dispair</span><span class="f2">despair not only</span></span> for herself <span class="app" id="app-4912s80"><span class="f1">and</span><span class="f2">but</span></span> for the <span class="app" id="z-8864"><span class="f2">whole</span></span> human race. <span class="app" id="app-4400b26"><span class="f1">Werewolves--that was what the</span><span class="f2">Werewolves.

<span class="app" id="app-5104o97"><span class="f1">Her</span><span class="f2">In the end, in spite of their qualms, her</span></span> parents had accepted it as <span class="app" id="app-5232p67"><span class="f1">well, although they had not been happy about it, not at all.</span><span class="f2">well.</span></span> There was little <span class="app" id="z-9344"><span class="f2">else</span></span> they could <span class="app" id="app-5168z84"><span class="f1">do but accept,</span><span class="f2">do,</span></span> although Stanley Uris<span class="app" id="z-9248"><span class="f1">was studying advanced eccouating and</span></span> would <span class="app" id="app-5232p51"><span class="f1">shortly</span><span class="f2">soon</span></span> be sallying forth into a<span class="app" id="z-9152"><span class="f1">desperately depressed</span></span> job-market <span class="app" id="app-5168a70"><span class="f1">ga</span><span class="f2">glutted with young accountants—and when he went into that jungle, he would do so</span></span> with no family <span class="app" id="app-5296v69"><span class="f1">fincances behind him</span><span class="f2">finances</span></span> to backstop <span class="app" id="app-5104d99"><span class="f1">his entry into a dangerous world--an entry he would make, apparantly,</span><span class="f2">him, and</span></span> with their only daughter as his hostage to fortune.

She was</span><span class="f2">with</span></span> a <span class="app" id="app-5296t64"><span class="f1">woman. The most the Blums had been able to do was to persuade them to wait until they were both working. And to have Stanley's parents for dinner.</span><span class="f2">B. A.</span></span>
"I'll be supporting that four-eyed son of a bitch for the rest of my life," Patty had heard her father say one <span class="app" id="z-9536"><span class="f1">night near ese end of the spring vacation. </span></span>
<span class="app" id="app-5168y59"><span class="f1">The two of them</span><span class="f2">night.

"Shh, she'll hear you," <span class="app" id="app-5424b87"><span class="f1">Mary</span><span class="f2">Ruth</span></span> Blum said.
<span class="app" id="app-5296c98"><span class="f1">She</span><span class="f2">Patty</span></span> had lain awake that night until long after midnight, <span class="app" id="z-9920"><span class="f2">dry-eyed, alternately hot</span></span> and <span class="app" id="z-9968"><span class="f2">cold, hating them both. She</span></span> had spent the next two years <span class="app" id="app-5168w34"><span class="f1">learning how not</span><span class="f2">trying</span></span> to <span class="app" id="app-5232k17"><span class="f1">add a hate</span><span class="f2">get rid</span></span> of <span class="app" id="z-9776"><span class="f2">that hate; there was too much hate inside</span></span> her <span class="app" id="app-5104t49"><span class="f1">own father</span><span class="f2">already. Sometimes when she looked into the mirror she could see the things it was doing</span></span> to her <span class="app" id="z-9680"><span class="f1"> other hates.</span><span class="f2"> face, the fine lines it was drawing there.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="app-5232j98"><span class="f1">That one she had</span><span class="f2">That was a battle she</span></span> won. Stanley had helped her.
His <span class="app" id="z-9488"><span class="f2">own</span></span> parents had been equally concerned about the <span class="app" id="app-5168r25"><span class="f1">marrlage, had considered it nasty (although</span><span class="f2">marriage.

Donald Uris and Andrea Bertoly</span></span> had <span class="app" id="z-9440"><span class="f2">themselves</span></span> married in their early twenties, <span class="app" id="app-5104i94"><span class="f1">their idea of a marriage that was not hasty apparantly consisted of vows taken by partners on</span><span class="f2">but they seemed to have forgotten</span></span> the <span class="app" id="app-5232o79"><span class="f1">darker side of forty).</span><span class="f2">fact.</span></span>
Only Stanley had seemed sure of himself,<span class="app" id="z-9728"><span class="f1">unconcerned,</span></span> confident <span class="app" id="app-5552a70"><span class="f1">© tne future.</span><span class="f2">of the future, unconcerned with the pitfalls their parents saw strewn all about"the kids."</span></span> And <span class="app" id="z-112"><span class="f2">in the end it was</span></span> his <span class="app" id="app-5104w22"><span class="f1">confldence</span><span class="f2">confidence rather than their fears which</span></span> had been <span class="app" id="app-5168j58"><span class="f1">justified in every way.</span><span class="f2">justified.</span></span> In July of <span class="app" id="app-5616e53"><span class="f1">that year, 1970,</span><span class="f2">1972,</span></span> with the ink <span class="app" id="app-5232b45"><span class="f1">still drying</span><span class="f2">barely dry</span></span> on her diploma, Patty had landed a job teaching <span class="app" id="app-5104n29"><span class="f1">junior high school</span><span class="f2">shorthand and business</span></span> English in <span class="app" id="app-5552f67"><span class="f1">the</span><span class="f2">Traynor, a</span></span> small town<span class="app" id="z-9872"><span class="f1">of Traynor,</span></span> forty miles south of Atlanta. <span class="app" id="z-352"><span class="f2">When she thought of how she had come by that job, it always struck her as a little—well, eerie.</span></span> She had <span class="app" id="app-5232u58"><span class="f1">tamubena-fumbowapt preliminary applications through</span><span class="f2">made a list of forty possibles from the ads in the</span></span> teachers' journals, <span class="app" id="app-5104a33"><span class="f1">everywhere from Oregon</span><span class="f2">then had written forty letters over five nights—eight each evening—requesting further information on the job,</span></span> and <span class="app" id="app-5616t40"><span class="f1">Idaho to Rhode Island. She</span><span class="f2">an application for each. Twenty-two replies indicated that the positions</span></span> had <span class="app" id="app-5168u97"><span class="f1">winnowed</span><span class="f2">been filled. In other cases, a more detailed explanation of</span></span> the <span class="app" id="app-5232m41"><span class="f1">list to half</span><span class="f2">skills needed made it clear she wasn't in the running; applying would only be</span></span> a <span class="app" id="app-5552t43"><span class="f1">dozen not-very-possibles,</span><span class="f2">waste of her time</span></span> and <span class="app" id="z-208"><span class="f2">theirs. She had finished with a dozen possibles. Each looked as likely as any other.</span></span> Stanley had <span class="app" id="z-448"><span class="f2">come in while she was puzzling over them and wondering if she could possibly manage to fill out a dozen teaching applications without going totally bonkers. He looked at the strew of papers on the table and then</span></span> tapped the letter from the Traynor Superintendent of <span class="app" id="app-5104k23"><span class="f1">Schools.</span><span class="f2">Schools, a letter which to her looked no more or less encouraging than any of the others.</span></span>
"There," he said.
She looked <span class="app" id="z-256"><span class="f2">up</span></span> at him,<span class="app" id="z-544"><span class="f1">a little</span></span> startled by the simple certainty in his voice. "Do you know <span class="app" id="z-592"><span class="f1"> Georgia?" She asked. </span><span class="f2"> something about Georgia that I don't?"</span></span>
<span class="app" id="app-5680"><span class="f1">Stan shook his head. "Grew up in central Maine, moved to Massachusetts when</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-64"><span class="f2">"Nope. Only time</span></span> I was <span class="app" id="app-5552e84"><span class="f1">sixteen, then came to school here." These were all things she knew, of course. "Never been south of</span><span class="f2">ever there was at</span></span> the <span class="app" id="z-304"><span class="f1"> Mason-Dixon line [in my life." He grinned. </span><span class="f2"> movies." She looked at him, an eyebrow cocked.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-400"><span class="f1">"Then why--" </span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-496"><span class="f1">"Because it's right." </span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-16"><span class="f1">"You can't know that, Stanley." </span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-160"><span class="f2">"Gone with the Wind. Vivien Leigh. Clark Gable. 'I will think about it tomorrow, for tomorrow is anothah day. ' Do I sound like I come from the South, Patty?"</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-640"><span class="f2">"Yes. South Bronx. If you don't know anything about Georgia and you've never been there, then why—"</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-192"><span class="f2">"Because it's right."</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-240"><span class="f2">"You can't know that, Stanley."</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-288"><span class="f1">"But I do," he had said simply, and she had felt a ripple of</span><span class="f2">"Sure I can," he said simply. "I do." Looking at him, she had seen he wasn't joking: he really meant it. She had felt a ripple of</span></span> unease go up her <span class="app" id="app-5872f99"><span class="f1">back at that.</span><span class="f2">back.</span></span>
"How do you know?"
<span class="app" id="app-5808a75"><span class="f1">His smile</span><span class="f2">He</span></span> had <span class="app" id="app-6000"><span class="f1">faltered</span><span class="f2">been smiling</span></span> a <span class="app" id="app-5552z51"><span class="f1">little,</span><span class="f2">little. Now the smile faltered,</span></span> and for a moment he had seemed puzzled. His eyes had darkened, as if he looked inward, consulting some interior device which ticked and <span class="app" id="app-5936l11"><span class="f1">whIrred correctly,</span><span class="f2">whirred correctly</span></span> but which, ultimately, he <span class="app" id="app-5872u48"><span class="f1">did not understand.</span><span class="f2">understood no more than the average man understands the workings of the watch on his wrist.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-9952"><span class="f2">"The turtle couldn't help us," he said suddenly. He said that quite clearly. She heard it. That inward look—that look of surprised musing—was still on his face, and it was starting to scare her.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-384"><span class="f2">"Stanley? What are you talking about? Stanley?"</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-432"><span class="f2">He jerked. She had been eating peaches as she went over the applications, and his hand struck the dish. It fell on the floor and broke. His eyes seemed to clear.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-480"><span class="f2">"Oh, shit! I'm sorry."</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-528"><span class="f2">"It's all right. Stanley—what were you talking about?"</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-576"><span class="f2">"I forget," he said. "But I think we ought to think Georgia, babylove."</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-624"><span class="f2">"But—"</span></span>
"Trust <span class="app" id="app-5808o26"><span class="f1">me, babe,"</span><span class="f2">me,"</span></span> he said,<span class="app" id="z-48"><span class="f1">and</span></span> so she <span class="app" id="z-720"><span class="f1">had. </span><span class="f2">did.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-0"><span class="f1">The</span><span class="f2">Her</span></span> interview had gone <span class="app" id="app-5872w61"><span class="f1">smashingly, and she knew</span><span class="f2">smashingly.

Again, Stanley seemed almost preternaturally confident. He <span class="app" id="z-1392"><span class="f2">was young, personable, bright, apt. He</span></span> had made contacts working for <span class="app" id="app-6128j44"><span class="f1">Block,</span><span class="f2">Block. All</span></span> of <span class="app" id="app-5872z48"><span class="f1">course; he was young, personable, bright and apt.</span><span class="f2">these things were givens.</span></span> But he could not have known that Corridor <span class="app" id="app-6384m86"><span class="f1">Technics</span><span class="f2">Video, a pioneer in the nascent videotape business,</span></span> was about to settle on a huge patch of farmed-out land less than ten miles from the suburb <span class="app" id="app-6448k46"><span class="f1">whIch they</span><span class="f2">to which the Urises</span></span> had eventually moved<span class="app" id="z-864"><span class="f1">to</span></span> in <span class="app" id="app-6384o75"><span class="f1">ane. or</span><span class="f2">1979, nor could he have known</span></span> that Corridor would be in the market for an independent <span class="app" id="app-5872f96"><span class="f1">accounting</span><span class="f2">marketing</span></span> survey <span class="app" id="z-1536"><span class="f2">less than</span></span> a year after <span class="app" id="app-5936x24"><span class="f1">that.</span><span class="f2">its move to Traynor.</span></span> Even <span class="app" id="app-6512j72"><span class="f1">If he</span><span class="f2">if Stan</span></span> had <span class="app" id="app-6448c74"><span class="f1">known,</span><span class="f2">been privy to some of this information,</span></span> he surely<span class="app" id="z-1488"><span class="f1">never</span></span> could <span class="app" id="app-6512h51"><span class="f1">I</span><span class="f2">not</span></span> have believed<span class="app" id="z-1152"><span class="f1">that</span></span> they would give the job to a young, bespectacled <span class="app" id="app-6448p24"><span class="f1">bee Wit ee</span><span class="f2">Jew who also happened to be a damyankee—a Jew with an</span></span> easy grin, a <span class="app" id="app-6576b14"><span class="f1">hIipshot</span><span class="f2">hipshot</span></span> way of walking, <span class="app" id="z-1248"><span class="f2">a taste for bell-bottomed jeans on his days off,</span></span> and the last ghosts of his adolescent <span class="app" id="app-5936z41"><span class="f1">ao yet</span><span class="f2">acne still on his face. Yet</span></span> they <span class="app" id="app-6640x52"><span class="f1">had, and</span><span class="f2">had. They had. And</span></span> it seemed that Stan had known <span class="app" id="z-1296"><span class="f2">it</span></span> all <span class="app" id="app-6512t99"><span class="f1">along that they would.</span><span class="f2">along.</span></span>
His work for <span class="app" id="app-6448b82"><span class="f1">Technics had</span><span class="f2">CV</span></span> led to an offer of a full-time position with the <span class="app" id="app-5936g22"><span class="f1">company starting at better than thirty thousand dollars</span><span class="f2">company—starting salary, $30, 000</span></span> a year.
<span class="app" id="z-1584"><span class="f2">"And that really is only the start,"</span></span> Stanley <span class="app" id="app-6640p81"><span class="f1">had turned it down, telling them</span><span class="f2">told Patty in bed</span></span> that <span class="app" id="app-6512i36"><span class="f1">he would rather freelance.</span><span class="f2">night. "They are going to grow like corn in August, my dear. If no one blows up the world in the next ten years or so, they are going to be right up there on the big board along with Kodak and Sony and RCA."</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-1776"><span class="f2">"So what are you going to do?" she asked, already knowing.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-1920"><span class="f2">"I am going to tell them what a pleasure it was to do business with them," he said, and laughed, and drew her close, and kissed her. Moments later he mounted her, and there were climaxes—one, two, and three, like bright rockets going off in a night sky...but there was no baby.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-1968"><span class="f1">But the job</span><span class="f2">His work with Corridor Video</span></span> had brought him into contact with some of Atlanta's richest and most powerful <span class="app" id="app-6576w89"><span class="f1">men,</span><span class="f2">men—and they were both astonished to find that these men were mostly okay. In them they found a degree of acceptance</span></span> and <span class="app" id="app-5936l30"><span class="f1">enough</span><span class="f2">broad-minded kindliness that was almost unknown in the North. Patty remembered Stanley once writing home to his mother and father: The best rich men in America live in Atlanta, Georgia. I am going to help make some</span></span> of them <span class="app" id="app-6640n13"><span class="f1">liked him so</span><span class="f2">richer, and they are going to make me richer, and no one is going to own me except my wife, Patricia, and since I already own her, I guess</span></span> that <span class="app" id="app-6512t85"><span class="f1">by</span><span class="f2">is safe enough.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-1824"><span class="f2">By</span></span> the time they <span class="app" id="app-6448f79"><span class="f1">moved, he employed six people and</span><span class="f2">moved from Traynor, Stanley</span></span> was <span class="app" id="app-6576b59"><span class="f1">himself making over twice what Corridor Technics had offered him in mid-1974. in 1981,</span><span class="f2">incorporated and employed six people. In 1983</span></span> their income had <span class="app" id="app-5936f48"><span class="f1">broken into</span><span class="f2">entered unknown territory—territory of which Patty had heard only</span></span> the <span class="app" id="app-6640l29"><span class="f1">hitherto unsuspected (by Patty, at least) territory</span><span class="f2">dimmest rumors. This was the fabled land</span></span> of <span class="app" id="app-6512m21"><span class="f1">Six Figures.</span><span class="f2">SIX FIGURES.</span></span> And it had all happened with <span class="app" id="app-6448n52"><span class="f1">a</span><span class="f2">the</span></span> casual ease <span class="app" id="app-6576a47"><span class="f1">which had sometime</span><span class="f2">of slipping into a pair of sneakers on Saturday morning. This sometimes</span></span> frightened her. <span class="app" id="app-5936r76"><span class="f1">Only Stan had never seemed to be frightened, and once, when «he</span><span class="f2">Once she</span></span> had made an uneasy joke about deals with the <span class="app" id="app-6640q56"><span class="f1">devil, he</span><span class="f2">devil. Stanley</span></span> had laughed until he almost <span class="app" id="app-6512v73"><span class="f1">choked.</span><span class="f2">choked, but to her it hadn't seemed that funny, and she supposed it never would.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-2064"><span class="f2">The turtle couldn't help us.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-2112"><span class="f2">Sometimes, for no reason at all, she would wake up with this thought in her mind like the last fragment of an otherwise forgotten dream, and she would turn to Stanley, needing to touch him, needing to make sure he was still there.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-2160"><span class="f2">It was a good life—there was no wild drinking, no outside sex, no drugs, no boredom, no bitter arguments about what to do next.</span></span> There was <span class="app" id="z-2208"><span class="f2">only</span></span> a single <span class="app" id="app-6448p25"><span class="f1">cloud, and as she had suspected, it</span><span class="f2">cloud. It</span></span> was her mother who<span class="app" id="z-1728"><span class="f1">had</span></span> first <span class="app" id="app-6512e27"><span class="f1">voiced</span><span class="f2">mentioned</span></span> the <span class="app" id="app-6640h62"><span class="f1">problem aloud,</span><span class="f2">presence of this cloud. That</span></span> her mother <span class="app" id="app-6576v74"><span class="f1">who had first pointed to</span><span class="f2">would be</span></span> the <span class="app" id="app-6704v62"><span class="f1">cloud and announced its presence.</span><span class="f2">one to finally do so seemed, in retrospect, preordained.</span></span> It <span class="app" id="z-2256"><span class="f2">finally</span></span> came <span class="app" id="z-2352"><span class="f2">out</span></span> as a question in one of <span class="app" id="app-6448q41"><span class="f1">Mary</span><span class="f2">Ruth</span></span> Blum's <span class="app" id="app-6512n70"><span class="f1">letters, §She</span><span class="f2">letters. She</span></span> wrote Patty once a <span class="app" id="app-6640l51"><span class="f1">weok, and following the night of the bath, she had arrived like a great gore-crow in her flapping black coat; it had taken all of Patty's flagging will and energy not to give in to her mother's assuredly well-meant advice</span><span class="f2">week,</span></span> and <span class="app" id="app-6576k10"><span class="f1">comfortings. That</span><span class="f2">that</span></span> particular letter had arrived in <span class="app" id="app-6704p49"><span class="f1">1977.</span><span class="f2">the early fall of 1979.</span></span> It came forwarded from the old Traynor address and Patty read it in a living room filled with cardboard liquor-store <span class="app" id="app-6448e36"><span class="f1">boxes</span><span class="f2">cartons</span></span> from which <span class="app" id="z-2016"><span class="f2">spilled</span></span> their possessions, looking<span class="app" id="z-2448"><span class="f1">somehow</span></span> forlorn and uprooted and <span class="app" id="app-6704r63"><span class="f1">dispossed, spilled.</span><span class="f2">dispossessed.</span></span>
In most ways it <span class="app" id="app-6576u55"><span class="f1">oon</span><span class="f2">was</span></span> the usual <span class="app" id="app-6512u20"><span class="f1">Mary</span><span class="f2">Ruth</span></span> Blum Letter <span class="app" id="app-6768i83"><span class="f1">From</span><span class="f2">from</span></span> Home: four closely written<span class="app" id="z-2400"><span class="f1">pages on</span></span> blue <span class="app" id="app-6512c35"><span class="f1">paper--each sheet</span><span class="f2">pages, each one</span></span> headed JUST A NOTE FROM <span class="app" id="app-6576e34"><span class="f1">MARY--in her mother's</span><span class="f2">RUTH.

"Why would you want to?" Patty had responded.
This one was <span class="app" id="app-6448e25"><span class="f1">complete wlth all the</span><span class="f2">full of Mom's</span></span> usual <span class="app" id="app-6576y97"><span class="f1">news</span><span class="f2">brand</span></span> of <span class="app" id="app-6768l78"><span class="f1">old friends and relatives who</span><span class="f2">news; for Ruth Blum recollection was a broad delta, spreading out from the moving point of the now in an ever-widening fan of interlocking relationships. Many of the people of whom her mother wrote</span></span> were<span class="app" id="z-2304"><span class="f1">already</span></span> beginning to fade in Patty's memory like photographs in an old <span class="app" id="app-6576e74"><span class="f1">album.</span><span class="f2">album, but to Ruth all of them remained fresh. Her concerns for their health and her curiosity about their various doings never seemed to wane, and her prognoses were unfailingly dire.</span></span> Her father was still having too many <span class="app" id="app-6448y67"><span class="f1">stomach-aches; he</span><span class="f2">stomach-aches.

Her</span></span> mother's letter had <span class="app" id="z-3264"><span class="f2">just</span></span> brought it on sooner, <span class="app" id="app-7280z85"><span class="f1">that was all.</span><span class="f2">the way dust hurries the tickle in your nose into a sneeze.</span></span>
Stanley wanted <span class="app" id="app-6768c88"><span class="f1">children.</span><span class="f2">kids.</span></span> She wanted <span class="app" id="app-7408x87"><span class="f1">children.</span><span class="f2">kids.</span></span> They were as compatible on that subject as <span class="app" id="z-3456"><span class="f2">they were</span></span> on their<span class="app" id="z-3552"><span class="f1">casual life-style, their</span></span> enjoyment of Woody Allen's films,<span class="app" id="z-3600"><span class="f1">and</span></span> their <span class="app" id="app-7472o17"><span class="f1">Irregular attendence</span><span class="f2">more or less regular attendance</span></span> at <span class="app" id="app-7408a44"><span class="f1">the synagogue three miles away. The</span><span class="f2">synagogue, their political leanings, their dislike of marijuana, a hundred other things both great and small. There had been an</span></span> extra room <span class="app" id="app-6768w34"><span class="f1">In</span><span class="f2">in</span></span> the <span class="app" id="app-7536s76"><span class="f1">small house</span><span class="f2">Traynor house, which</span></span> they had <span class="app" id="app-6576w51"><span class="f1">rented in Traynor</span><span class="f2">split evenly down the middle.

There had been</span></span> an agreement <span class="app" id="z-2688"><span class="f2">between them about that room</span></span> so <span class="app" id="app-6576z92"><span class="f1">solid it barely needed to be spoken: someday</span><span class="f2">strong they rarely spoke of it—it was simply there, like their noses or</span></span> the <span class="app" id="z-3024"><span class="f2">wedding rings on their left hands. Someday that</span></span> room would belong to <span class="app" id="app-7472h29"><span class="f1">the child.</span><span class="f2">Andy or to Jenny.</span></span> But <span class="app" id="app-7408n91"><span class="f1">the child had not come.</span><span class="f2">where was that child?</span></span> The<span class="app" id="z-3648"><span class="f1">Singer</span></span> sewing machine and the<span class="app" id="z-3792"><span class="f1">wicker</span></span> baskets of fabric and <span class="app" id="app-7600z87"><span class="f1">patterns had never been replaced with a crib,</span><span class="f2">the cardtable</span></span> and<span class="app" id="z-3696"><span class="f1">in</span></span> the <span class="app" id="app-7408a49"><span class="f1">bathroom,</span><span class="f2">desk and the La-Z-Boy all kept their places, seeming each month to solidify their holds on their respective positions</span></span> in the <span class="app" id="app-7664k63"><span class="f1">cabinet under</span><span class="f2">room and to further establish their legitimacy. So she thought, although she never could quite crystallize the thought; like</span></span> the <span class="app" id="app-7472j43"><span class="f1">kitchen sink,</span><span class="f2">word pornographic, it was a concept that danced just beyond</span></span> her <span class="app" id="app-7728j78"><span class="f1">boxes of Sta-Free</span><span class="f2">ability to quantify. But she did remember one time when she got her period, sliding open the cupboard under the bathroom sink to get a</span></span> sanitary <span class="app" id="app-7600v77"><span class="f1">pads kept their place. The cardinal visited monthly;</span><span class="f2">napkin;</span></span> she <span class="app" id="app-7408a12"><span class="f1">was depressingly regular.</span><span class="f2">remembered looking at the box of Stayfree pads and thinking that the box looked almost smug, seemed almost to be saying: Hello, Patty! We are your children. We are the only children you will ever have, and we are hungry. Nurse us. Nurse us on blood.</span></span>
In <span class="app" id="app-7664q19"><span class="f1">1974,</span><span class="f2">1976,</span></span> three years after she had thrown away the last cycle of <span class="app" id="app-7472p72"><span class="f1">bIrthcontrol pllls,</span><span class="f2">Ovral tablets,</span></span> they saw a doctor named Harkavay in Atlanta. "We want to know if <span class="app" id="app-7728f37"><span class="f1">there's</span><span class="f2">there is</span></span> something wrong," Stanley said, "and<span class="app" id="z-3840"><span class="f1">if there Is,</span></span> we want to know if <span class="app" id="app-7472j35"><span class="f1">it</span><span class="f2">we</span></span> can <span class="app" id="z-3888"><span class="f1"> be fixed." </span><span class="f2"> do anything about it if there is."</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-3216"><span class="f1">So they</span><span class="f2">They</span></span> took the <span class="app" id="app-7792s22"><span class="f1">tests, which</span><span class="f2">tests. They</span></span> showed that <span class="app" id="app-7664e47"><span class="f1">Stan's</span><span class="f2">Stanley's</span></span> sperm was <span class="app" id="app-7856w77"><span class="f1">allve and well,</span><span class="f2">perky,</span></span> that Patty's eggs were fertile,<span class="app" id="z-3360"><span class="f1">and</span></span> that all the channels that were <span class="app" id="app-7664j12"><span class="f1">Supposed</span><span class="f2">supposed</span></span> to be open <span class="app" id="app-7792z84"><span class="f1">were, Nothing was wrong. Only everything.</span><span class="f2">were open.</span></span>
Harkavay, who wore no wedding <span class="app" id="app-7472s65"><span class="f1">ring,</span><span class="f2">ring</span></span> and who had the open, pleasant, ruddy face of a college <span class="app" id="app-7920w58"><span class="f1">graduate</span><span class="f2">grad</span></span> student <span class="app" id="app-7856t50"><span class="f1">Just</span><span class="f2">just</span></span> back from a midterm <span class="app" id="app-7664x75"><span class="f1">skling</span><span class="f2">skiing</span></span> vacation in Colorado, told them that <span class="app" id="app-7792x52"><span class="f1">their</span><span class="f2">maybe it was just nerves. He told them that such a</span></span> problem was by no means <span class="app" id="app-7472y26"><span class="f1">unique.</span><span class="f2">uncommon.</span></span> He told them that there seemed to be <span class="app" id="app-7920j48"><span class="f1">some sort of</span><span class="f2">a</span></span> psychological correlative in such <span class="app" id="app-7664r57"><span class="f1">cases. It was, he said, apparantly possible</span><span class="f2">cases that was in some ways similar</span></span> to <span class="app" id="app-7792x77"><span class="f1">simply want a child too much,</span><span class="f2">sexual impotency—the more you wanted to, the less you could.</span></span> They would have to relax. They ought, if they could, to<span class="app" id="z-3504"><span class="f1">try and</span></span> forget all about procreation when they had <span class="app" id="app-7792y72"><span class="f1">sex,</span><span class="f2">sex.</span></span>
Stan was grumpy on the way <span class="app" id="app-7664k80"><span class="f1">home,</span><span class="f2">home.</span></span> Patty asked him why.
"I never <span class="app" id="z-3744"><span class="f1">think of procreation during," he said. </span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-2976"><span class="f1">"You didn't believe him," she said, trying not to giggle. </span></span>
<span class="app" id="app-8048u78"><span class="f1">"I've discovered a great truth about myself today,"</span><span class="f2">do,"</span></span> he said.
<span class="app" id="app-7792p35"><span class="f1">"It's apparantly impossible for me</span><span class="f2">"Do what?"</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-5200"><span class="f2">"Think of procreation during."</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-5296"><span class="f2">She began</span></span> to <span class="app" id="z-5344"><span class="f1">believe in a doctor who looks like a graduate student and wears Dingo boots." </span></span>
<span class="app" id="app-8048m77"><span class="f1">Then she did glggle,</span><span class="f2">giggle,</span></span> even though she was <span class="app" id="z-4960"><span class="f2">by then</span></span> feeling a bit lonesome and<span class="app" id="z-5440"><span class="f1">a bit</span></span> frightened. And that night, <span class="app" id="z-5488"><span class="f2">lying</span></span> in bed, long after she believed that <span class="app" id="app-7472u22"><span class="f1">Stan</span><span class="f2">Stanley</span></span> must be asleep, he had frightened her by speaking <span class="app" id="app-8176t42"><span class="f1">in</span><span class="f2">out of</span></span> the <span class="app" id="app-7664m15"><span class="f1">dark: speaking in a</span><span class="f2">dark. His</span></span> voice<span class="app" id="z-5248"><span class="f1">that</span></span> was flat but nevertheless choked with tears. "It's me," he said. "It's my fault."
She rolled toward him, groped for him, held him.
<span class="app" id="app-8176c92"><span class="f1">"Stanley, don't</span><span class="f2">"Don't</span></span> be <span class="app" id="z-5104"><span class="f2">a</span></span> stupid," she said. But her heart was beating fast—much too fast. It wasn't just that he had startled her; it was as if he had looked into her mind and read a secret conviction<span class="app" id="z-5008"><span class="f1">that</span></span> she held <span class="app" id="app-7792x19"><span class="f1">there. with</span><span class="f2">there but of which she had not known until this minute. With</span></span> no rhyme, no reason, she <span class="app" id="app-7472t48"><span class="f1">felt--she knew--that there</span><span class="f2">felt—knew—that he was right. There</span></span> was something <span class="app" id="app-7664p10"><span class="f1">wrong...and</span><span class="f2">wrong, and</span></span> it wasn't her. It <span class="app" id="app-8304y89"><span class="f1">was, as he had said,</span><span class="f2">was</span></span> him. Something in him.
"Don't be such a klutz," she whispered fiercely against his shoulder. He was sweating <span class="app" id="app-7792u87"><span class="f1">lightly,</span><span class="f2">lightly</span></span> and she<span class="app" id="z-5056"><span class="f1"> suddenly</span></span> became <span class="app" id="z-5728"><span class="f2">suddenly</span></span> aware that he was <span class="app" id="app-7664n59"><span class="f1">afraid, the</span><span class="f2">afraid. The</span></span> fear was coming off him in cold waves; lying naked with him was suddenly like <span class="app" id="app-8304m85"><span class="f1">being</span><span class="f2">lying</span></span> naked in front of an open refrigerator.
"I'm not <span class="app" id="z-5632"><span class="f2">a klutz and I'm not</span></span> being stupid," he said in that same<span class="app" id="z-5824"><span class="f1">flat, teary</span></span> voice, <span class="app" id="z-5872"><span class="f2">which was simultaneously flat and choked with emotion,</span></span> "and you know it. It's me. But I don't know why."
"You can't know any such thing." Her voice was harsh, scolding—her mother's voice when her mother was afraid. And even as she scolded <span class="app" id="app-7664n81"><span class="f1">him,</span><span class="f2">him</span></span> a shudder ran through her body, twisting <span class="app" id="z-5536"><span class="f2">it</span></span> like a whip. <span class="app" id="app-8240f92"><span class="f1">Stanley's</span><span class="f2">Stanley felt it and his</span></span> arms tightened around her.
<span class="app" id="z-5584"><span class="f1">He had felt it. </span></span>
<span class="app" id="app-7664z54"><span class="f1">"I know it, and so do you,"</span><span class="f2">"Sometimes,"</span></span> he <span class="app" id="app-7792u80"><span class="f1">said again. Hoe fell silent for a moment and then said: "Sometimes</span><span class="f2">said, "sometimes</span></span> I think I know why. Sometimes I have a dream, a bad dream, and I wake up and I think, 'I know now. I know what's wrong.' <span class="app" id="app-8304v81"><span class="f2">Not just you not catching pregnant—everything. Everything that's wrong with my life."</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-5392"><span class="f2">"Stanley, nothing's wrong with your life!"</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-6064"><span class="f2">"I don't mean from inside," he said. "From inside is fine. I'm talking about outside. Something that should be over and isn't. I wake up from these dreams and think, 'My whole pleasant life has been nothing but the eye of some storm I don't understand. ' I'm afraid.</span></span> But then it <span class="app" id="app-8368y79"><span class="f1">just fades.</span><span class="f2">just...fades.</span></span> The way dreams do."
She knew <span class="app" id="z-6016"><span class="f2">that</span></span> he <span class="app" id="z-6160"><span class="f2">sometimes</span></span> dreamed <span class="app" id="app-8240c74"><span class="f1">uneasilly sometimes.</span><span class="f2">uneasily.</span></span> On half a dozen occasions he had awakened her, thrashing and moaning. <span class="app" id="app-7664m74"><span class="f1">On</span><span class="f2">Probably there had been</span></span> other <span class="app" id="app-7792r87"><span class="f1">occasions</span><span class="f2">times when</span></span> she had<span class="app" id="z-5152"><span class="f1">perhaps</span></span> slept through his dark interludes. Whenever she <span class="app" id="z-6256"><span class="f2">reached for him,</span></span> asked him, he said the same thing: I can't remember. <span class="app" id="app-8368y68"><span class="f1">And then</span><span class="f2">Then</span></span> he would reach for his cigarettes and smoke sitting up in bed, waiting for the <span class="app" id="z-5920"><span class="f2">residue of the</span></span> dream to pass through his pores <span class="app" id="app-7664t37"><span class="f1">and join the swirling currents of smoke, sucked out into the night by the fan in the window. It'll pass, he had toid her once or twice, after particularly</span><span class="f2">like</span></span> bad <span class="app" id="z-6112"><span class="f1"> ones. They always pass, hon. </span><span class="f2"> sweat.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-6304"><span class="f1">Their childlessness had not passed, and on</span><span class="f2">No kids.

Her <span class="app" id="app-8432t87"><span class="f1">mother</span><span class="f2">mother, who was much occupied with her own affairs but not entirely oblivious to her daughter's pain,</span></span> had stopped asking in her letters and when <span class="app" id="app-7664b66"><span class="f1">Stan</span><span class="f2">Stanley</span></span> and Patty made their twice-yearly <span class="app" id="app-8304t74"><span class="f1">visits.</span><span class="f2">trips back to New York.</span></span> There were no more humorous remarks about whether <span class="app" id="z-6448"><span class="f2">or not</span></span> they were taking their vitamin E.<span class="app" id="z-6496"><span class="f1">Perhaps she had seen the pain in her daughter's eyes, or perhaps she had read It between the lines of Patty's bright, brief notes.</span></span> Stanley had <span class="app" id="app-7664i24"><span class="f1">never mentioned it again either,</span><span class="f2">also stopped mentioning babies,</span></span> but sometimes, when <span class="app" id="app-8432b14"><span class="f1">he</span><span class="f2">she</span></span> didn't know <span class="app" id="app-8240u88"><span class="f1">she</span><span class="f2">he</span></span> was looking, she saw a shadow on his face. Some shadow. As if he were trying <span class="app" id="z-5776"><span class="f2">desperately</span></span> to remember <span class="app" id="app-8496g51"><span class="f1">something--like a bad dream upon waking.</span><span class="f2">something.</span></span>

On the back was</span></span> a <span class="app" id="app-8304f22"><span class="f1">balding</span><span class="f2">bald</span></span> man<span class="app" id="z-5680"><span class="f1">who was</span></span> wearing <span class="app" id="z-6736"><span class="f1"> thick glasses on the back. </span><span class="f2"> glasses.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-6784"><span class="f1">The phone rang. </span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-6208"><span class="f1">Stan, who</span><span class="f2">Stan</span></span> was sitting <span class="app" id="app-8624l82"><span class="f1">next to it,</span><span class="f2">nearer the phone. He</span></span> picked it up and <span class="app" id="app-7664y24"><span class="f1">said as he always did: "Hello, Uris</span><span class="f2">said, "Hello—Uris</span></span> residence."
He listened, and a frown line delved<span class="app" id="z-6688"><span class="f1">its way</span></span> between his eyebrows. "Who did you say?"
Patty felt an instant of fright. Later, shame would cause her to lie and tell her parents that she had known something was wrong from the instant the telephone had rung, <span class="app" id="app-8624l15"><span class="f1">when</span><span class="f2">but</span></span> in reality there had only been that one instant, that one quick look <span class="app" id="app-8688j62"><span class="f1">upward</span><span class="f2">up</span></span> from her sewing. But maybe that was all right. Maybe<span class="app" id="z-6592"><span class="f1">long before that phone call</span></span> they had both suspected that something was <span class="app" id="app-8624f43"><span class="f1">coming,</span><span class="f2">coming long before that phone call,</span></span> something that didn't fit with the nice house <span class="app" id="app-7664a55"><span class="f1">itseach</span><span class="f2">set tastefully back</span></span> behind the <span class="app" id="z-6400"><span class="f2">low</span></span> yew <span class="app" id="app-8752b86"><span class="f1">hedges.</span><span class="f2">hedges, something so much a given that it really didn't need much of an acknowledgment...that one sharp instant of fright, like the stab of a quickly withdrawn icepick, was enough.</span></span>
Is it Mom? <span class="app" id="app-8880u69"><span class="f1">She</span><span class="f2">she</span></span> mouthed at him in that <span class="app" id="app-8688c85"><span class="f1">instant of fright,</span><span class="f2">instant,</span></span> thinking that perhaps her father, twenty pounds overweight and prone to what he <span class="app" id="app-7664y72"><span class="f1">always called "the bellyache,"</span><span class="f2">called "the bellyache" since his early forties,</span></span> had had a heart attack.
Stan shook his head at her, and then smiled a bit at something the voice on the phone was saying. <span class="app" id="app-8752l51"><span class="f1">"You...well,</span><span class="f2">"You...you! Well,</span></span> I'll be goddamned! Mike! How <span class="app" id="app-8880p73"><span class="f1">did--"</span><span class="f2">did y—"</span></span>
He fell silent again,<span class="app" id="z-6880"><span class="f1">the smile fading,</span></span> listening. <span class="app" id="app-8752u97"><span class="f1">She</span><span class="f2">As his smile faded she</span></span> recognized—or thought she <span class="app" id="app-7664e97"><span class="f1">recognized--his</span><span class="f2">did—his</span></span> analytic expression, the one <span class="app" id="app-8688b25"><span class="f1">that</span><span class="f2">which</span></span> said someone was unfolding a problem or explaining a sudden change in <span class="app" id="app-8944y21"><span class="f1">some</span><span class="f2">an</span></span> ongoing <span class="app" id="app-8880a49"><span class="f1">situation.

This last</span></span> was <span class="app" id="app-8752b33"><span class="f1">a client, then.</span><span class="f2">probably the case, she gathered. A new client? An old friend? Perhaps.</span></span> She turned her attention back to the TV, where a woman<span class="app" id="z-6544"><span class="f1">from Omaha</span></span> was <span class="app" id="app-8880h21"><span class="f1">entering</span><span class="f2">flinging her arms around Richard Dawson and kissing him madly. She thought that Richard Dawson must get kissed even more than</span></span> the <span class="app" id="app-8944f63"><span class="f1">Bonus Round.</span><span class="f2">Blarney stone. She also thought she wouldn't mind kissing him herself.</span></span>
As she began searching for a black button to match the ones on <span class="app" id="app-7664b78"><span class="f1">Stan's</span><span class="f2">Stanley's</span></span> blue denim shirt, Patty was vaguely aware that <span class="app" id="app-9008d64"><span class="f1">Stan had settled down to an occaslonal grunt</span><span class="f2">the conversation was settling into a smoother groove—Stanley grunted occasionally,</span></span> and <span class="app" id="app-8752n22"><span class="f1">an "Are</span><span class="f2">once he asked:"Are</span></span> you <span class="app" id="app-8880q34"><span class="f1">sure?" besIde her. Finally</span><span class="f2">sure, Mike?" Finally, after a very long pause,</span></span> he said, "All right,<span class="app" id="z-6832"><span class="f1">Mike. I think</span></span> I <span class="app" id="app-8752s27"><span class="f1">understand</span><span class="f2">understand. Yes, I...Yes. Yes,</span></span> everything. <span class="app" id="app-9008r30"><span class="f1">I...no,</span><span class="f2">I have the picture. I...what?...No,</span></span> I can't <span class="app" id="z-6928"><span class="f2">absolutely</span></span> promise that, but I'll <span class="app" id="app-8944l27"><span class="f1">think</span><span class="f2">consider</span></span> it <span class="app" id="app-9072"><span class="f1">over.</span><span class="f2">carefully.</span></span> You know <span class="app" id="app-8880k22"><span class="f1">that...what?</span><span class="f2">that...oh?...He did?...Well, you bet!</span></span> Of course I do. Yes...sure...thank you...yes. <span class="app" id="app-8752l82"><span class="f1">Yes. Goodbye."</span><span class="f2">Bye-bye."</span></span> He hung up.
<span class="app" id="app-9008p62"><span class="f1">She looked over</span><span class="f2">Patty glanced at him</span></span> and saw him staring blankly into<span class="app" id="z-7216"><span class="f1">the</span></span> space over the TV set. On her show, the audience was applauding the <span class="app" id="app-8752g81"><span class="f1">woman, who</span><span class="f2">Ryan family, which</span></span> had just <span class="app" id="app-8880t27"><span class="f1">won a Chevrolet Caprice. In her living room, Stanley</span><span class="f2">scored two hundred and eighty points, most of them by guessing that the audience survey would answer "math" in response to the question "What class will people say Junior hates most in school?" The Ryans were jumping up and down and screaming joyfully. Stanley, however,</span></span> was <span class="app" id="app-8944t55"><span class="f1">wearing what</span><span class="f2">frowning. She would later tell her parents</span></span> she thought <span class="app" id="app-9136o18"><span class="f1">of es  +rhs--Protten expression. His</span><span class="f2">Stanley's</span></span> face had <span class="app" id="app-9008w39"><span class="f1">seemed</span><span class="f2">looked</span></span> a little off-color, <span class="app" id="z-7264"><span class="f2">and so she did,</span></span> but she <span class="app" id="z-7312"><span class="f2">neglected to tell them she</span></span> had dismissed <span class="app" id="app-8752e38"><span class="f1">that</span><span class="f2">it at the time</span></span> as <span class="app" id="z-7024"><span class="f2">only a trick of</span></span> the table-lamp, with its green glass shade.
"Who was that, Stan?"
<span class="app" id="app-8880u29"><span class="f1">"Hmmm?"</span><span class="f2">"Hmmmm?"</span></span> He looked around at <span class="app" id="app-8944w60"><span class="f1">her, abstracted. Or so she had thought.</span><span class="f2">her. She thought the look on his face was one of gentle abstraction, perhaps mixed with minor annoyance.</span></span> It was only later, replaying <span class="app" id="app-9136d69"><span class="f1">it</span><span class="f2">the scene in her mind</span></span> again and again, that she <span class="app" id="app-9008w94"><span class="f1">came</span><span class="f2">began</span></span> to believe<span class="app" id="z-7360"><span class="f1">that</span></span> it was the expression of a man who was <span class="app" id="z-7456"><span class="f2">methodically</span></span> unplugging <span class="app" id="z-7504"><span class="f2">himself</span></span> from reality,<span class="app" id="z-7552"><span class="f1">doing it methodically,</span></span> one cord at a time. The face of a man who was heading out of the blue and into the black.
<span class="app" id="app-9136e54"><span class="f1">"Who,</span><span class="f2">"Who was that</span></span> on the phone?"
"No one," he <span class="app" id="app-8752m15"><span class="f1">said, and stood up. "I</span><span class="f2">said. "No one, really. I</span></span> think I'll take a bath." <span class="app" id="app-8880s54"><span class="f2">He stood up.</span></span>
<span class="app" id="z-6640"><span class="f1">"At</span><span class="f2">"What, at</span></span> seven o'clock?"
He didn't <span class="app" id="app-9200y86"><span class="f1">answer;</span><span class="f2">answer,</span></span> only left the room. She might have<span class="app" id="z-7120"><span class="f1">said something, might have</span></span> asked <span class="app" id="z-7696"><span class="f2">him</span></span> if something was wrong, <span class="app" id="z-7744"><span class="f2">might even have gone after him and asked him if he was sick to his stomach—he was sexually uninhibited,</span></span> but <span class="app" id="app-9136v35"><span class="f1">the next contestant</span><span class="f2">he could be oddly prim about other things, and it wouldn't be at all unlike him to say he was going to take a bath when what he really had to do</span></span> was <span class="app" id="z-7072"><span class="f2">whoops something which hadn't agreed with him. But now a new family, the Piscapos, were</span></span> being <span class="app" id="app-8752v93"><span class="f1">introduced</span><span class="f2">introduced,</span></span> and Patty <span class="app" id="z-7600"><span class="f2">just knew Richard Dawson would find something funny to say about that name, and besides, she</span></span> was having <span class="app" id="app-8880r64"><span class="f1">a devi! of a</span><span class="f2">the devil's own</span></span> time finding a black <span class="app" id="app-9008g61"><span class="f1">button to go on Stan's blue shirt. Last month</span><span class="f2">button, although she knew there were loads of them in</span></span> the button <span class="app" id="app-9200i17"><span class="f1">box had seemed to contain nothing but.</span><span class="f2">box. They hid, of course; that was the only explanation. . . .</span></span></pre>
